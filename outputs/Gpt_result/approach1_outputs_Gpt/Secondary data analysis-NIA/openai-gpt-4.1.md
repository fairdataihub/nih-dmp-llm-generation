**Element 1: Data Type**

1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   The proposed work will not generate new primary data. Instead, the project will perform secondary analyses using existing datasets, specifically the publicly available Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data and HRS-linked Medicare data, which are accessible via a data use agreement. The scientific data generated will primarily consist of derived analytic datasets, summary statistics, and statistical code created through the analysis of these existing resources. The estimated amount of data generated will be modest, likely under 10 GB, as the main outputs will be processed datasets and code rather than raw data.

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   Scientific data that will be preserved and shared include the analytic code (e.g., scripts for data cleaning, variable construction, and statistical analyses), data dictionaries, and summary-level results derived from the secondary analyses, as permissible under the associated data use agreements. Raw HRS or HRS-linked Medicare data will not be shared, as these are subject to existing data sharing policies and restrictions by the original data providers. Sharing analytic code and derived, non-identifiable summary data will facilitate transparency, reproducibility, and reuse of the research approach without violating the original data use agreements.

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   Metadata and documentation to be made accessible will include data dictionaries for derived variables, codebooks, detailed protocols describing the analytic approach, and README files explaining the structure and content of shared files. If applicable, documentation about data cleaning, harmonization, and analytic decisions will also be included to facilitate interpretation and reuse.

**Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:**  
The analytic code will be developed primarily in statistical software such as Stata and/or R. Access to these tools is required for full use of the shared code, but open-source alternatives (e.g., R) will be prioritized when possible. All code and associated documentation will be provided in standard formats (e.g., .do, .R, .txt) and will reference the version of the software used. Information on obtaining R (free and open-source) or Stata (commercial) will be provided in the documentation.

**Element 3: Standards:**  
Common data standards from the HRS and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) datasets will be adhered to, including variable naming conventions and coding structures as defined by the original data providers. Metadata standards will follow the Dublin Core schema where applicable, to ensure interoperability and discoverability. If no consensus standards are available for specific derived variables, clear documentation and data dictionaries will be provided.

**Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines**

1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   Analytic code, data dictionaries, and summary-level data will be archived in a recognized and publicly accessible repository such as the NIH-supported Open Science Framework (OSF) or the NIA Data Archive, as appropriate.

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   Shared products will be assigned persistent unique identifiers (such as Digital Object Identifiers [DOIs]) through the chosen repository, and will be indexed with appropriate keywords and metadata to maximize discoverability.

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   All shared scientific data and code will be made available no later than the time of publication of associated results or at the end of the performance period, whichever comes first. The data and documentation will remain available for a minimum of 5 years after completion of the project, in compliance with NIH and repository policies.

**Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations**

1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   Sharing of raw HRS and HRS-linked Medicare data is restricted by data use agreements and by the data providers’ policies. Only derived, non-identifiable summary data and analytic code will be shared. There are no anticipated restrictions on the reuse of these shared materials, provided users comply with the original data providers’ terms and do not attempt to re-identify research participants.

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   Access to analytic code and summary-level data will be open and unrestricted. Users seeking access to the original HRS and HRS-linked Medicare data must apply directly to the relevant data custodians and comply with their data use agreements and procedures.

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   No individual-level data will be shared. All shared outputs will be aggregate, de-identified, and consistent with the privacy and confidentiality protections enforced by HRS and CMS. The original data sources have obtained broad consent for data sharing, and all analyses will comply with applicable IRB approvals and data use agreements.

**Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:**  
The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring compliance with the Data Management and Sharing Plan. Oversight will be conducted in coordination with the institutional data steward and research administration office. Compliance will be reviewed at least annually, and prior to any data or code release. Documentation of compliance will be maintained as part of the project records and will be available for audit or review upon request.
