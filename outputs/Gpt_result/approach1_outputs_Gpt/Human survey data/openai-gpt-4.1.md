**Element 1: Data Type**

1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   This project will generate nationally representative cross-sectional data from survey interviews and time diaries involving approximately 2,500 children aged 8–17 years and 1,500 primary caregivers. The data will comprise: (a) structured survey interview responses from children and caregivers, (b) child time diary records detailing daily activities, (c) recoded and processed variables including top-coded or collapsed categories, (d) scale composites derived from interview responses, and (e) individual-level linkages to external data sources such as detailed school data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and contextual geocode-based data for families’ places of residence. The estimated amount of raw and processed data is approximately 200 MB in CSV and Stata formats, plus associated documentation.

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   The preserved and shared data will include all de-identified, participant-level data from the survey interviews, child time diaries, recoded variables, scale composites, and linked contextual and school data, consistent with the informed consent for broad data sharing. Data sharing of these elements will allow for secondary analyses, replication, and meta-analytic studies while supporting open science and NICHD’s mission. Direct identifiers and any potentially re-identifiable data will be excluded in order to protect participant privacy.

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   The following metadata and documentation will be made accessible to facilitate interpretation and reuse: codebooks describing variables and coding schemes, data dictionaries, survey instruments and time diary forms, protocols for data collection and processing, methodology descriptions, data processing scripts (where applicable), and data provenance documentation, including details of linkage to NCES and geocoded contextual datasets.

**Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:**  
The primary data will be provided in open, non-proprietary formats (CSV, TXT) as well as Stata (.dta) and/or SPSS (.sav) formats. No specialized or proprietary software is required to access the CSV/TXT files; Stata or SPSS software may be needed for users who wish to utilize those formats. All necessary data processing scripts and code (e.g., for scale construction or variable recoding) will be provided in R and/or Stata syntax files and will be freely accessible alongside the data.

**Element 3: Standards:**  
The project will use established data standards for social science research, including the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) for metadata, and variable naming and coding conventions consistent with ICPSR and other major social science repositories. Variable and value labels will be clearly defined; missing data codes and top-coding rules will follow standard practices. Linked data elements from NCES and geocoded contextual sources will be documented according to their respective standards. If no consensus standard is available for a specific data element, detailed documentation will be provided.

**Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines**

1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   Scientific data and metadata will be archived in the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) repository, which is a widely used NIH-recommended repository for social and behavioral science data. Additionally, appropriate data documentation will be made available through the NICHD Data and Specimen Hub (DASH).

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   The datasets will be assigned a persistent Digital Object Identifier (DOI) by ICPSR. Metadata records will be indexed and searchable via the ICPSR and NICHD DASH portals, as well as through general internet search engines and data catalogs.

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   Data will be made available no later than at the time of publication of the main study results or by the end of the performance period, whichever comes first, in accordance with NIH policy. Data will remain available through ICPSR and NICHD DASH for a minimum of 10 years, or as long as these repositories are operational.

**Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations**

1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   All participants will be consented for broad data sharing. However, access to some linked contextual and school data may be subject to additional restrictions imposed by the original data providers (e.g., NCES) or by risk of re-identification, particularly when geocoded information is involved. Direct identifiers will be removed, and all datasets will be reviewed for disclosure risk. Any data use limitations will be documented in the data use agreements and metadata.

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   Access to the primary de-identified participant-level data will be controlled via ICPSR’s restricted data access protocols. Users will be required to apply for access, agree to data use terms, and provide evidence of institutional review board (IRB) approval or exemption as appropriate.

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   Data will be de-identified in accordance with HIPAA and federal guidelines, with all direct identifiers removed and indirect identifiers minimized or masked (e.g., top-coding, suppression of small cell sizes, generalization of geocodes). A Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained to provide additional legal protections. Only data from participants who have consented to broad data sharing will be included. All data sharing will comply with IRB-approved protocols and applicable laws and regulations.

**Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:**  
Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be overseen by the project’s Data Steward (Project Data Manager), in collaboration with the Principal Investigator. The Data Steward will monitor data management activities, ensure timely deposit of data and documentation in ICPSR and NICHD DASH, and coordinate with the institution’s Office of Research Compliance. Oversight will be continuous, with formal reviews occurring at quarterly project meetings and at major project milestones (e.g., data collection completion, data deposit).
