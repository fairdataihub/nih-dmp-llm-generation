**Element 1: Data Type**

1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   This project will perform secondary data analysis of kidney magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data available from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). The main scientific data expected to be generated is a clinical dataset containing estimated parenchymal kidney volumes for each subject included in the analysis. The dataset will also include relevant de-identified demographic and clinical variables (e.g., age, sex, relevant comorbidities) necessary for analysis and interpretation. The total dataset is expected to contain approximately 500-1,000 records (subjects), with each record consisting of 10-20 variables. The estimated size of the final dataset is less than 10 MB.

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   The primary scientific data to be preserved and shared is the derived clinical dataset of estimated kidney volumes along with associated de-identified demographic and clinical variables. The rationale for preserving and sharing these data is to enable reproducibility of the results, facilitate secondary analyses by other investigators, and advance research in kidney disease phenotyping. The original MRI images are not generated by this project and are already available in dbGaP; thus, only the derived data will be generated and shared.

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   To facilitate data interpretation, the following documentation and metadata will be provided:  
   - Data dictionary with detailed variable descriptions  
   - Data processing and analysis protocol (including algorithms and parameters used for kidney volume estimation)  
   - Documentation of cohort selection criteria  
   - Codebook describing value ranges and coding schemes  
   - README file with data use instructions and contact information

**Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:**  
The derived dataset will be provided in standard formats (CSV and/or Excel), which can be accessed using common statistical and spreadsheet software (e.g., R, Python, Microsoft Excel, SAS). Any custom code used for kidney volume estimation and data processing (e.g., scripts in R or Python) will be shared via a public repository (such as GitHub) and referenced in the documentation. No specialized or proprietary software will be required for data access.

**Element 3: Standards:**  
The clinical dataset will adhere to the NIH-recommended data standards for human subject research. Variables will be mapped to common data elements (CDEs) where applicable, such as those from the NIDDK Central Repository and the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC). Data will be de-identified according to HIPAA standards. Metadata will be provided using standard formats (e.g., data dictionaries, README files) to ensure interoperability. If no consensus standard exists for a given variable, definitions and coding will be clearly documented.

**Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines**

1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   The derived dataset, metadata, and associated documentation will be deposited in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Central Repository. If required for broader access, data may also be submitted to dbGaP as a derived dataset.

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   Upon deposition, the dataset will be assigned a persistent unique identifier (e.g., DOI or accession number) by the NIDDK Central Repository (or dbGaP). The dataset will be indexed and discoverable via the repository’s search tools and NIH’s RePORTER system.

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   The dataset will be made available no later than the time of publication of the primary results or at the end of the grant performance period, whichever comes first. The data will remain available for at least 10 years after initial release, in accordance with NIH and NIDDK repository policies.

**Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations**

1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   All research participants have provided informed consent for broad data sharing. The dataset will be de-identified to protect privacy. Access and reuse are subject to compliance with applicable data use agreements and institutional review board (IRB) guidelines. There are no anticipated restrictions beyond those necessary to protect participant confidentiality and comply with regulatory requirements.

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   Yes, access to the derived dataset will be controlled. Interested investigators will be required to apply for data access through the NIDDK Central Repository (or dbGaP), and requests will be reviewed for consistency with data use limitations and participant consent.

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   All shared data will be de-identified according to HIPAA Safe Harbor standards prior to deposition. No direct identifiers or protected health information will be included. Data use will be governed by repository data access agreements that require users to protect participant privacy and confidentiality. The project will comply with all institutional and NIH policies regarding human subject data protections, including the use of Certificates of Confidentiality as applicable.

**Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:**  
Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be overseen by the Principal Investigator (PI) in coordination with the project’s Data Steward and the Institutional Office of Research Compliance. Oversight will include quarterly reviews of data collection, de-identification, and sharing procedures. The PI will ensure timely data deposition and documentation, and the institution’s Data Management Committee will conduct periodic audits to ensure adherence to the plan and NIH policies.
