**Element 1: Data Type**

1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   The project will generate high-fidelity (HiFi) long-read whole-genome sequencing data from a single human HeLa cell line (ATCC). Sequencing will be performed using the PacBio platform, yielding high-accuracy long-read data suitable for resolving complex genomic regions. The total expected data output is approximately 700 megabytes (MB), representing the complete genome sequence of the HeLa cell line at high resolution.

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   The raw HiFi long-read sequencing data (in FASTQ/BAM format), the assembled genome sequence (in FASTA format), and associated variant call files (VCF) will be preserved and shared. Sharing these data will enable reproducibility, facilitate methodological advancements in genome assembly and variant calling, and promote secondary analyses by the broader genomics community. Given the HeLa cell line’s status as a widely used research resource, sharing comprehensive, high-resolution sequencing datasets will maximize the scientific impact of this project.

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   The following metadata and documentation will be provided:  
   - Sample metadata (source, cell line identifier, passage number, and acquisition details from ATCC)
   - Sequencing metadata (platform, chemistry, run parameters, coverage statistics)
   - Data processing pipeline descriptions (software versions, parameters used for assembly and variant calling)
   - Study protocols, including DNA extraction and sequencing library preparation
   - Data dictionaries and README files to facilitate interpretation and re-use

**Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:**  
Data will be shared in standard formats (FASTQ, BAM, FASTA, VCF) that are compatible with widely-used bioinformatics tools. Recommended software for data access and analysis includes SAMtools, bcftools, IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer), and PacBio SMRT Link. All these tools are freely available and can be accessed via their respective websites or open-source repositories. Custom scripts or pipelines (if developed) will be shared via GitHub with appropriate documentation.

**Element 3: Standards:**  
Data and metadata will adhere to accepted community standards for genomic data:  
- Sequencing data will be formatted according to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) guidelines (FASTQ/BAM).
- Assembled genomes will be provided in FASTA format, and variant calls in VCF format, following specifications by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH).
- Metadata will conform to the Minimum Information about a Genome Sequence (MIGS) and the BioSample metadata standards.
- Data processing and analysis protocols will be documented using the Protocols.io standard and included as supplementary documentation.

**Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines**

1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   Scientific data and metadata will be deposited in the NIH-supported Sequence Read Archive (SRA) for raw sequencing reads, and the Genome Sequence Archive (GenBank/ENA/DDBJ) for assembled genomes and variant data. Associated metadata will be submitted to BioSample and BioProject databases.

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   Data sets will be assigned persistent unique identifiers (accession numbers) by the SRA, GenBank, and BioSample repositories. These identifiers will be referenced in publications and made publicly available through standard repository indexing and search tools.

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   All scientific data and metadata will be made publicly available no later than the time of first publication of the results or at the end of the project performance period, whichever comes first. Data will remain accessible in the repositories for a minimum of 10 years in accordance with NIH policy and repository guidelines.

**Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations**

1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   All research participants (HeLa cell line donors) have been consented for broad data sharing, and the HeLa cell line is a widely used and consented immortalized cell line. No additional limitations are anticipated regarding access or reuse. Data will be shared in accordance with NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy and applicable data use certifications.

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   Access to the scientific data will be open (uncontrolled) given the broad consent for sharing and the public nature of the HeLa cell line. Data will be deposited in public repositories with unrestricted access.

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   The HeLa cell line is derived from a historical research participant and is widely used as a public resource. No personally identifiable information will be included with the data. All data will be de-identified and compliance with applicable policies (including Certificates of Confidentiality, if required) will be maintained to ensure the privacy and rights of individuals are respected.

**Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:**  
Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be overseen by the Principal Investigator (PI) in collaboration with the institution’s Data Steward and the Office of Research Compliance. Oversight will include quarterly reviews of data management activities, verification of timely data deposition, and ongoing monitoring to ensure adherence to NIH policies. Documentation of compliance will be maintained and reported as part of annual progress reports and at the time of publication.
