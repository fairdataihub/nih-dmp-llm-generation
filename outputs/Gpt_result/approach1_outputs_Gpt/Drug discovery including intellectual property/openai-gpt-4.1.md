**Element 1: Data Type**

1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   The project will generate the following types of scientific data:  
   - **Compound Design and Production Protocols**: Documentation for the design, synthesis, purification, and characterization protocols for approximately 30 analogs of Compound A (~30 protocol files, estimated 10-20 MB total).  
   - **In Vitro and Cell-Based Assay Data**: Quantitative and qualitative assay data (e.g., dose-response curves, IC50/EC50 values, raw and processed data tables, images) for 30 Compound A analogs (~50-75 data files, estimated 500 MB).  
   - **Substance Stability and Toxicology Data**: In vitro and in vivo toxicology data for 10 analogs, using 6 wild-type (WT) mice per dose across 5 doses (~30 spreadsheets, 10-20 MB; includes body weight, clinical signs, pathology, and stability metrics).  
   - **Pharmacokinetics (ADME) Data**: ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) data for 3-4 compounds tested in 5xFAD mice (10 mice per dose, 4 doses; ~20-30 spreadsheets, 10-20 MB, including plasma/brain concentration-time profiles).  
   - **Preclinical PET Imaging Data**: PET imaging raw and processed data for 2-3 compounds in 15 WT or 5xFAD mice per compound (~100-200 DICOM files, processed images, and ROI analyses; estimated 20-30 GB).  

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   All raw and processed scientific data underlying published results will be preserved and shared. This includes:  
   - Protocols for compound design, synthesis, and purification (to enable reproducibility)
   - Raw and analyzed assay data for all tested analogs (for transparency and secondary analysis)
   - Toxicology and pharmacokinetic datasets (to support safety and efficacy claims)
   - Raw and processed PET imaging files and associated quantitative analyses (to enable re-use and meta-analysis)
   Data that are not intended for preservation include internal communications, preliminary notes, and data unrelated to published results. The rationale for sharing is to maximize transparency, reproducibility, and re-use in accordance with NIH and NIA policies.

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   The following metadata and documentation will be made available:
   - Detailed protocol documents for compound synthesis, purification, and assays
   - Data dictionaries describing all variables and coding schemes
   - Experimental design metadata (e.g., animal IDs, genotypes, dosing regimens, timepoints)
   - Instrumentation settings (e.g., PET scanner configuration, assay plate layouts)
   - README files describing dataset structure and file organization
   - Software version information for any analysis tools used

**Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:**  
Standard data files (e.g., CSV, XLSX, PDF for protocols, DICOM for imaging) will be used.  
- PET imaging data may require DICOM-compatible viewers (e.g., OsiriX, ImageJ/Fiji, PMOD), all of which are freely available or have academic licenses.
- Custom analysis scripts (e.g., for pharmacokinetic modeling or image quantification) written in R, Python, or MATLAB will be included as supplementary files, with usage instructions provided.  
- No proprietary or restricted-access software is required for basic data access.

**Element 3: Standards:**  
- Data will be formatted according to relevant community standards:
  - **PET Imaging:** DICOM standard for raw and reconstructed imaging data.
  - **Tabular Data:** Comma-separated values (CSV) with accompanying data dictionaries following MIAME (Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment) and ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines where applicable.
  - **Protocols:** PDF or .docx format, with protocol metadata as per Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations (MIBBI) guidelines.
  - **Metadata:** Described using schema.org and DataCite metadata standards to facilitate interoperability.
- If consensus standards do not exist for a particular data type, clear documentation will be provided.

**Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines**

1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   - **Protocols:** Protocols.io (https://www.protocols.io)
   - **Assay, toxicology, and pharmacokinetic data:** Figshare (https://figshare.com) or NIA-supported data repository (e.g., AD Knowledge Portal)
   - **PET imaging data:** OpenNeuro (https://openneuro.org) for imaging data, or NITRC (Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse, https://www.nitrc.org)
   - All repositories comply with NIH criteria for data preservation and accessibility.

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   - Each dataset will be assigned a persistent unique identifier (DOI) through the chosen repository.
   - Metadata will be indexed and searchable via repository search tools and through integration with PubMed and other indexing services.
   - Datasets will be cited in publications using their respective DOIs.

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   - Data will be made publicly available no later than the time of publication of the main results or at the end of the NIH award period, whichever occurs first.
   - Data will remain available in the selected repositories for a minimum of 10 years, in accordance with repository and NIH guidelines.

**Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations**

1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   - No human subject data are included in this project; all data are from in vitro experiments and animal models.
   - All data will be de-identified and free of proprietary or sensitive information.
   - There are no known legal, ethical, or intellectual property constraints that would limit sharing, beyond standard citation and attribution requirements.

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   - All datasets will be shared via open access unless repository policies require registration.
   - No additional data use agreements or approvals are anticipated for reuse.

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   - Not applicable; no human participant data will be generated or shared under this project.

**Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:**  
Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be overseen by the Principal Investigator (PI) and the project’s designated Data Steward (e.g., Research Data Manager).  
- Oversight will include quarterly reviews of data curation status, repository submissions, and documentation completeness.
- The Data Steward will be responsible for ensuring timely data upload, metadata quality, and adherence to data sharing timelines.
- Compliance will be reviewed annually by the institution’s Office of Research Compliance or equivalent body.
