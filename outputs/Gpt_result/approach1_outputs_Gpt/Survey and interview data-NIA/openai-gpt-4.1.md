**Element 1: Data Type**

1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   The project will generate three primary types of data from approximately 250 participants at three timepoints: (1) objective physical activity data collected via accelerometers, (2) quantitative survey responses assessing caregiver well-being, and (3) qualitative data from semi-structured interviews captured as digital audio recordings and subsequently transcribed. Estimated data volume includes approximately 750 accelerometer files (one per participant per timepoint), 750 survey records, and 750 interview recordings/transcripts.

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   All de-identified accelerometer data, survey responses, and interview transcripts will be preserved and shared in accordance with NIH and NIA data sharing policies. Sharing these datasets will enable replication, secondary analyses, and further research into caregiver well-being and physical activity. Raw audio files will be preserved but shared only with appropriate protections due to the potential for re-identification.

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   Metadata to accompany shared datasets will include participant demographic descriptors (age range, sex, relationship to care recipient), timepoint indicators, device information, and data collection dates (as per privacy guidelines). Associated documentation will include study protocols, data collection instruments (surveys, interview guides), codebooks for survey data, and a description of accelerometer device settings and data processing workflows.

**Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:**  
Accelerometer data will be provided in standard CSV format and can be accessed using common statistical software (e.g., R, Python, SPSS, SAS). No specialized proprietary software is required. Interview transcripts and survey data will be provided in plain text or CSV format. Any custom scripts used for data cleaning or processing will be shared on a public repository (e.g., GitHub) with documentation.

**Element 3: Standards:**  
Data and metadata will follow relevant standards to maximize interoperability. Accelerometer data will adhere to the [National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR)](https://sleepdata.org/) and [Open mHealth](https://www.openmhealth.org/) data schemas where applicable. Survey data will follow the [Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC)](https://www.cdisc.org/) standards for tabular data. Metadata will be provided using [Dublin Core Metadata Element Set](https://dublincore.org/). For qualitative data, the [COREQ](https://academic.oup.com/intqhc/article/19/6/349/1791966) (Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research) guidelines will be followed. If any additional standards become available during the project period, these will be adopted.

**Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines**

1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   Scientific data and associated metadata will be deposited in the [NIH-supported National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging (NACDA)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/NACDA/), which specializes in data relevant to aging research, and/or the [NIH Figshare generalist repository](https://nih.figshare.com/) if appropriate.

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   Each dataset will be assigned a persistent unique identifier (e.g., Digital Object Identifier [DOI]) through the repository. Datasets will be indexed and searchable using keywords, project title, principal investigator, and funding information.

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   Data will be made available no later than the time of first publication of major findings or the end of the award period, whichever occurs first. Data will remain accessible in the repository for a minimum of 10 years following deposition, in accordance with repository policies and NIH guidelines.

**Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations**

1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   All participants will provide informed consent for broad data sharing. However, due to the sensitive nature of qualitative interview data and potential for re-identification, access to raw audio files and detailed transcripts will be restricted and subject to data use agreements. Aggregated or coded data will be available without restriction.

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   Access to de-identified survey and accelerometer data will be open. Access to qualitative interview transcripts and audio recordings will be controlled and require data use agreements and approval by a data access committee to ensure protection of participant privacy.

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   All data will be de-identified prior to sharing; direct identifiers will be removed, and indirect identifiers will be minimized. Audio recordings will be stored securely and released only under controlled access. A Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained from the NIH. All data sharing will comply with applicable federal, state, and institutional regulations and IRB-approved protocols.

**Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:**  
The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan, with oversight by the project Data Manager and the Institutional Data Steward. Compliance will be reviewed quarterly during project meetings and audited annually by the institution’s Office of Research Compliance. Any protocol deviations or data sharing requests will be documented and reviewed by the IRB and Data Access Committee as appropriate.
