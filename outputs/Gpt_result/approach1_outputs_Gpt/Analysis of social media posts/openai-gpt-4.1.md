**Element 1: Data Type**

1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   The project will generate three primary types of scientific data:  
   - **Social Media Posts and Comments:** Approximately 300,000 publicly available social media posts, including images and videos, along with associated comments.  
   - **Survey Data:** Quantitative survey responses from 500 young adult participants (ages 18-34) enrolled in an Instagram-delivered intervention, including demographic data, intervention assignment, and variables of interest.  
   - **User Analytics:** Program monitoring data for the 500 participants, including social media engagement metrics (views, comments, shares), as well as coded thematic data from participants’ posts within the intervention and control groups.  
   The total volume of data is anticipated to be approximately 200 GB, given the inclusion of multimedia content.

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   All de-identified, coded scientific data generated during the project will be preserved and shared, including:  
   - The processed and de-identified dataset of social media posts, comments, and associated coding (e.g., topic, sentiment, accuracy).  
   - The de-identified survey dataset, including group assignments and all recoded variables.  
   - The aggregated and de-identified user analytics and coded thematic results.  
   Sharing these datasets will support transparency, reproducibility, and enable secondary analyses relevant to cancer communication, social media research, and intervention science. Only de-identified data will be shared to protect participant confidentiality.

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   The following metadata and documentation will be made available:  
   - Data dictionaries for all datasets, detailing variable names, coding schemes, and value labels.  
   - Study protocol, including eligibility criteria and recruitment materials.  
   - Copies of survey instruments and codebooks.  
   - Data processing and cleaning documentation, including code used for de-identification and coding.  
   - README files describing file organization and analytic methods.  

**Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:**  
Most data files will be provided in open, non-proprietary formats (e.g., CSV for tabular data, JSON for structured text, JPEG/MP4 for images and video). Data analysis code (e.g., for data cleaning, coding, and analysis) written in R and/or Python will be provided with accompanying documentation. These tools are freely available for download and use. No specialized or proprietary software is required for data access or manipulation.

**Element 3: Standards:**  
Standard data and metadata formats will be used to maximize interoperability:  
- Variable names and coding will follow common conventions in behavioral and health research (e.g., NIH Common Data Elements for demographics where possible).  
- Metadata will comply with the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) standard for social science data and follow FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).  
- For multimedia files, standard file formats (JPEG for images, MP4 for video) will be used, with accompanying metadata.  
- Survey instruments and codebooks will be documented per NIH guidelines.  
No discipline-specific consensus standards for social media research data currently exist, but best practices for de-identification and data sharing will be followed.

**Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines**

1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   All scientific data and metadata will be archived in the NCI-supported [Cancer Data Access System (CDAS)](https://cdas.cancer.gov/) and the [NIH Figshare repository](https://nih.figshare.com/) for public access, as appropriate. Data will also be registered in the [NIH Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI)](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/grei) if required.

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   Datasets will be assigned persistent digital object identifiers (DOIs) or accession numbers by the chosen repository. Metadata will be indexed and searchable using standard repository tools and through PubMed and related research data catalogs.

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   Data will be made available no later than the time of publication of the main findings or at the end of the project performance period, whichever comes first. Data will remain publicly accessible in the repositories for a minimum of 10 years from the date of deposition, in accordance with NIH and repository policies.

**Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations**

1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   All data will be de-identified prior to sharing. For social media data, only content that is publicly available and consistent with platform terms of service will be included, and all identifiers will be removed. Survey and analytics data will be shared in a form that precludes re-identification. Data use will be subject to a Data Use Agreement (DUA) prohibiting attempts to re-identify individuals and requiring appropriate citation. No other major restrictions are anticipated.

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   Survey and user analytics datasets will be available under controlled access, requiring data requestors to sign a DUA and obtain approval from the data access committee. Social media data, once fully de-identified, may be made available under open access, provided that sharing is consistent with platform policies and ethical standards.

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   All data will be de-identified according to established best practices before sharing. Direct and indirect identifiers (e.g., names, social media handles, user IDs, URLs, or location data) will be removed. Data will be aggregated or masked as necessary to prevent re-identification, especially for small subgroups. All participants will provide informed consent for data sharing. The study will obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality from NIH to further protect participant privacy and rights.

**Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:**  
The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for oversight of data management and sharing, supported by a designated Data Manager/Data Steward. Compliance will be monitored quarterly through internal data audits and annual progress reports. Oversight responsibilities include ensuring adherence to the approved DMSP, verifying de-identification prior to sharing, and maintaining documentation of data requests and releases. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) will review data sharing procedures annually to ensure ongoing protection of research participants.
