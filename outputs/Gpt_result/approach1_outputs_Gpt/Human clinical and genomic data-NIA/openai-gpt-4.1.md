**Element 1: Data Type**

1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   This project will generate whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from 3,200 non-Hispanic White (NHW) cases with Late-onset Alzheimer’s Disease (LOAD) and matched controls. In addition, the study will generate genome-wide association study (GWAS) and exome sequencing data from blood samples collected from 1,000 African American (AA) cases and matched controls and 1,343 Hispanic (HI) cases and matched controls. Familial WGS will be conducted in 1,012 individuals each from NHW and HI families, respectively. Associated phenotypic data—including clinical subtypes, endophenotypes, and relevant biomarkers—will also be collected and shared. The estimated total data size to be generated is approximately 30 terabytes (TB).

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   All raw and processed sequencing data (i.e., FASTQ, BAM/CRAM, and VCF files) generated from WGS, GWAS, and exome sequencing will be preserved and shared. Accompanying phenotypic data, including demographic information, clinical diagnoses, endophenotypes, and biomarker datasets, will also be preserved and shared. The rationale for sharing these data is to maximize the utility and reproducibility of the research, in accordance with NIH and NIA policies, and to enable secondary analyses by the scientific community for further discovery in Alzheimer’s disease genetics and health disparities.

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   Metadata to be shared will include detailed sample-level and study-level metadata (e.g., subject IDs, ancestry, case/control status, sequencing platform, library preparation methods, and data processing pipelines). Additional documentation will include study protocols, informed consent forms, data dictionaries, data collection instruments, and a data use limitations statement. Data harmonization and quality control documentation will also be provided to facilitate proper interpretation of the scientific data.

**Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:**  
Standard genomic data formats (FASTQ, BAM/CRAM, VCF) will be used, which are compatible with widely used bioinformatics tools such as SAMtools, GATK, PLINK, and bcftools. No proprietary or specialized software is required for basic access; all necessary tools are open-source and publicly available. Where relevant, links to recommended software and code for data preprocessing or analysis pipelines will be provided in the dataset documentation, including version numbers and access instructions.

**Element 3: Standards:**  
Data and metadata will adhere to established community standards for genomic and phenotypic data. Genomic data will follow the standards set by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA), and the dbGaP (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes). Phenotypic and clinical data will use standardized vocabularies such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), ICD-10 codes, and Common Data Elements (CDEs) where applicable. Metadata will conform to the Minimal Information About a Sequencing Experiment (MINSEQE) guidelines. These standards will be applied throughout data generation, curation, and submission processes to ensure interoperability and reusability.

**Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines**

1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   All sequencing and phenotypic data, along with associated metadata and documentation, will be deposited in the NIH-designated repositories dbGaP (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes) and the National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer’s Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS), both of which are approved for the storage of human genomic and phenotypic data.

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   Data submissions will be assigned persistent unique identifiers (e.g., accession numbers in dbGaP and NIAGADS), and will be indexed in repository catalogs for discoverability. Metadata will include descriptive information and keywords to facilitate searchability via standard indexing tools (e.g., NIH RePORTER, dbGaP, NIAGADS portals).

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   Scientific data will be made available no later than the time of publication of the primary results or at the end of the performance period, whichever occurs first, in accordance with NIH guidelines. Data will remain available through the designated repositories for a minimum of 10 years after the end of the project or as per repository policies.

**Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations**

1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   All research participants will be consented for broad data sharing; however, access to individual-level genomic and phenotypic data will be subject to data use limitations to protect participant privacy and confidentiality. Data will be shared under terms consistent with the informed consent provided by participants, and in compliance with applicable federal, state, and institutional regulations governing human subjects research.

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   Yes, access to individual-level data will be controlled. Data will be made available to qualified investigators through the dbGaP and NIAGADS approved access processes, which require submission and approval of a Data Access Request (DAR) and a Data Use Certification (DUC) agreement.

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   All data will be de-identified prior to sharing in accordance with HIPAA and NIH guidelines. Identifiable information will be removed, and each subject will be assigned a unique study ID. Data will be shared only via NIH-approved controlled-access repositories with established procedures for data access review and monitoring. A Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained for the study. Data use agreements will require adherence to privacy and confidentiality standards, including prohibitions on re-identification and redistribution.

**Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:**  
Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be overseen by the study’s Data Management and Sharing Lead (DMS Lead), in collaboration with the Principal Investigator (PI) and the institutional Office of Research Compliance. The DMS Lead will monitor data collection, curation, and submission activities on a quarterly basis and ensure that data are submitted to the designated repositories in accordance with NIH policy and project timelines. The PI will provide overall oversight, and compliance will be audited annually by the institution’s Data Governance Committee. Any issues or deviations will be reported and addressed promptly to ensure ongoing compliance.
