### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *The proposed project is anticipated to generate several types of high-throughput sequencing data from 20 human cell lines obtained from BIOBANK X, utilizing technologies developed by Small Business X Technology. The primary datasets include:*
   - *Nanopore sequence data*: Long-read sequencing data will be produced for all 20 human cell lines using Oxford Nanopore technology. This is expected to yield approximately 100 GB of data per cell line, enabling comprehensive structural variant detection and improved genome assembly.
   - *30x whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data*: High-coverage short-read sequencing will be performed on the same 20 cell lines to generate detailed genomic variant data, anticipating about 500 GB of data per cell line.
   - *RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data*: Transcriptomic profiling will be conducted on all cell lines, aiming for approximately 50 GB of data per cell line, to capture gene expression dynamics and support integrative omics analyses.

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All generated sequencing data (Nanopore, WGS, and RNA-seq) along with associated metadata will be preserved and shared. The rationale behind this decision is to facilitate open access to comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic information, promoting collaborative research, validation of findings, and advancement in the field of genomics and human health.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *To facilitate interpretation and reuse of the scientific data, the following will be made accessible:*
   - *Sample metadata*: Information on cell line origin, processing protocols, and sequencing parameters.
   - *Study protocols*: Detailed descriptions of experimental design, methods used for data generation, and quality control measures.
   - *Data collection instruments*: Any software or tools utilized in data acquisition and analysis.

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software are necessary for accessing and manipulating the shared scientific data. Specifically, users will need access to bioinformatic analysis pipelines capable of handling high-throughput sequencing data, such as those utilizing Python, R, or specialized genomic analysis software like SAMtools, BWA, and GATK. These tools can be accessed through various open-source repositories and bioinformatics platforms.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*To ensure interoperability and facilitate the integration of datasets, the project will adhere to established data standards for genomic and transcriptomic data, including but not limited to:*
- *FASTQ and SAM/BAM formats for sequencing data*.
- *VCF format for variant calling data*.
- *BED and GTF formats for genomic feature data*.
These standards are widely adopted in the genomics community, enabling efficient data exchange and analysis across different platforms.

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The scientific data and associated metadata arising from this project will be archived in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, specifically through repositories like the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) for raw sequencing data and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for processed RNA-seq data.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Each dataset will be assigned a unique identifier (e.g., SRA accession numbers, GEO series IDs), facilitating easy location and access through standard indexing tools and search interfaces provided by the repositories.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available to other users no later than the time of publication of the main findings or at the end of the performance period, whichever comes first. The data are expected to remain accessible indefinitely, as per the policies of the chosen repositories, to support long-term research and validation.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *Given that all research participants will provide consent for broad data sharing, there are no anticipated limitations on access, distribution, or reuse related to informed consent. However, privacy and confidentiality protections will be ensured through de-identification of human subjects’ data and adherence to relevant regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).* 

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the scientific data will not be controlled beyond the standard access controls implemented by the repositories where the data are archived, ensuring open access to the research community.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect the privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants, all shared data will be de-identified. Additionally, the project will comply with all relevant federal regulations and guidelines concerning human subjects research, including obtaining a Certificate of Confidentiality if necessary, to safeguard sensitive information.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the Principal Investigator (PI) in collaboration with the institution’s Research Data Management Office. Regular oversight will occur through quarterly project meetings where data generation, sharing progress, and any challenges encountered will be discussed. The PI and designated data managers will ensure that all data sharing activities adhere to the outlined plan, relevant policies, and ethical standards.*
