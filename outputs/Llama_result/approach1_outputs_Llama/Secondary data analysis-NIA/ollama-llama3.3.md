### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *The proposed work will utilize existing publicly available data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and HRS-linked Medicare data accessible through a data use agreement. The types of data include survey responses, administrative claims data, and potentially linked genetic information, if available. Given that no new data collection is planned, the amount of scientific data generated will be dependent on the secondary analyses performed.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All derived datasets from the secondary analysis of HRS and HRS-linked Medicare data will be preserved and shared. The rationale for sharing these data is to maximize research efficiency, facilitate replication studies, and encourage further investigations into aging mechanisms and outcomes, aligning with NIA’s mission.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *Metadata will include variable descriptions, data dictionaries, study protocols, and any modifications made to the original datasets during analysis (e.g., data cleaning steps, imputation methods). Associated documentation will comprise study reports, publications, and presentation materials related to the project outcomes.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software needed for access or manipulation of shared scientific data include statistical analysis packages like R or SAS, potentially specific libraries for handling large datasets (e.g., dplyr in R), and data visualization tools. Access to these tools can be obtained through academic licenses or open-source repositories.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*Common data standards applied will include those recommended by the NIH for demographic and clinical data, such as the use of standardized vocabularies (e.g., ICD-10 for medical conditions) and data formats (e.g., CSV for tabular data). For metadata, standards like the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) will be considered to enable interoperability and facilitate understanding of the datasets.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging (NACDA), housed within the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), is identified as a suitable repository for archiving scientific data and metadata arising from this project, given its relevance to aging research.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Scientific data will be made findable through the assignment of a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and indexed in search engines like Google Dataset Search or specific databases related to aging research. Descriptive metadata will enable easy identification of the datasets.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *Derived datasets from this project will be made available no later than the time of publication of the main findings or at the end of the performance period, whichever comes first. Data will remain accessible for a minimum of 10 years after the project’s completion to allow for longitudinal analyses and replication studies.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *Given that all research participants are consented for broad data sharing, limitations on data sharing will primarily stem from privacy and confidentiality protections. Specifically, any direct identifiers will be removed, and sensitive information (e.g., exact addresses) will be aggregated or suppressed to protect participant confidentiality.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the shared datasets will not require additional approval beyond what is typically required by the chosen repository for accessing similar datasets.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect participant privacy, all shared datasets will undergo rigorous de-identification procedures. This includes but is not limited to removing direct identifiers (e.g., names, social security numbers), aggregating or suppressing sensitive variables, and applying statistical disclosure limitation methods as necessary.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored by the project’s Principal Investigator in collaboration with the institution’s research data management office. Regular checks (every 6 months) will ensure adherence to the plan, including timely deposition of datasets into the designated repository and maintenance of accurate metadata. Any deviations or challenges encountered during implementation will be addressed through adjustments to the plan as needed, with documentation of such changes kept on record.*
