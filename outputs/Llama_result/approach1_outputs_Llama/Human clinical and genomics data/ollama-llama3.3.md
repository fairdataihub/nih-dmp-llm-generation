### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *This study expects to generate a significant amount of clinical and genomic data from approximately 1000 participants. Clinical data will include demographical information, insurance status, medical history, medications, lab tests (both from clinical sites and central laboratories), physical exams data, and other relevant clinical data collected at varying frequencies over up to 12 months. Genomic data will comprise individual-level data including Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), shallow Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), and DNA methylation arrays (EPIC), totaling around 10 TB of genomic data.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All clinical and genomic data collected during this study will be preserved and shared. The rationale is to contribute to the broader scientific community's understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype in the context of this study, facilitating future research, replication studies, and meta-analyses that could lead to significant advancements in healthcare and treatments.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *Metadata will include participant identifiers, collection dates, types of assays performed, and technical details about genomic analyses (e.g., sequencing depth, coverage). Other relevant data will encompass study protocols, case report forms used for clinical data collection, and detailed descriptions of bioinformatic pipelines used for genomic data analysis. Associated documentation will also include consent forms that explicitly allow for broad data sharing.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools, software, and code are needed to access or manipulate shared scientific data. For genomic data analysis, this may include bioinformatic pipelines such as BWA for alignment, GATK for variant calling, and R packages for statistical analysis. Access to these tools can be facilitated through open-source repositories like GitHub or Bioconductor, where applicable.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*Common data standards applied will include those recommended by the NIH for genomic data (e.g., VCF for variant calls) and clinical data (e.g., CDISC standards for clinical trials data). Metadata standards such as ISA-Tab will be used to describe experimental conditions, sample characteristics, and assay details. These standards enable interoperability of datasets and resources, facilitating their integration and analysis across different studies.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The scientific data and metadata arising from this project will be archived in the NICHD DASH repository as well as other NIH-approved repositories for genomic and clinical data (e.g., dbGaP for genomic data, ClinicalTrials.gov for clinical trial data).*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Scientific data will be made findable and identifiable through the use of persistent unique identifiers such as DOI numbers or accession numbers provided by the repositories where the data are archived.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available no later than the time of publication of the main findings from the study or at the end of the performance period, whichever comes first. The data will remain available for at least 10 years after the study's completion to allow for extended research and validation studies.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *Given that all participants are consented for broad data sharing, limitations on access, distribution, or reuse will primarily pertain to protecting participant privacy and confidentiality. However, no additional factors beyond standard protections for human subjects research are anticipated.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to certain aspects of the genomic data may be controlled through mechanisms like dbGaP, which requires users to apply for access and agree to terms of use that protect participant confidentiality.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect participant privacy, rights, and confidentiality, all shared data will be de-identified according to HIPAA guidelines. The study has also obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH to further safeguard against disclosure of sensitive information.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the study's Principal Investigator in collaboration with the institution's data management and compliance offices. Regular oversight meetings (at least quarterly) will ensure that data collection, storage, sharing, and protection practices adhere to the plan and all relevant regulations and guidelines.*
