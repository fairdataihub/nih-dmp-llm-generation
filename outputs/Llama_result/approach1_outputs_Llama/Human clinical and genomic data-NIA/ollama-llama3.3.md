### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *This study aims to generate whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from human blood samples of 3,200 non-Hispanic White (NHW) cases with Late-onset Alzheimer’s Disease (LOAD) and matched controls. Additionally, GWAS and exome sequencing data will be generated using blood samples from diverse populations: 1,000 African American (AA) cases and matched controls, and 1,343 Hispanic (HI) cases and matched controls. Familial WGS will also be completed in 1,012 NHW and HI individuals, respectively. The estimated total data size is approximately 30 TB. Associated phenotypic data, including clinical subtypes, endophenotypes, and biomarkers, will also be collected and shared.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All generated WGS, GWAS, exome sequencing, and associated phenotypic data will be preserved and shared. The rationale for sharing these data is to facilitate research into the genetic underpinnings of Alzheimer’s Disease, particularly in diverse populations, thereby accelerating the discovery of potential therapeutic targets and improving our understanding of disease mechanisms. Broad sharing of these data will enable other researchers to validate findings, explore new hypotheses, and combine data from multiple studies to achieve more robust conclusions.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *The metadata to be shared include sample identifiers, sequencing protocols, data processing pipelines, and quality control metrics. Other relevant data include demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity), clinical diagnoses, and biomarker measurements. Associated documentation will comprise study protocols, informed consent forms, and detailed descriptions of the methodologies used for data generation and analysis.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools, software, and/or code needed to access or manipulate shared scientific data include bioinformatics pipelines for variant calling (e.g., GATK), genotyping (e.g., PLINK), and data analysis (e.g., R, Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy). These can be accessed through public repositories (e.g., GitHub) or downloaded from official software websites. Documentation on how to use these tools will be provided alongside the shared data.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*Common data standards applied to the scientific data and associated metadata include those recommended by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) for genomic data, and the PhenX toolkit for phenotypic data. These standards enable interoperability of datasets and resources, facilitating combination and comparison of data across studies. Specifically, VCF (Variant Call Format) will be used for genetic variant data, and standardized ontologies (e.g., HPO for human phenotypes) will be applied to phenotypic descriptions.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *Scientific data and metadata arising from the project will be archived in the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) and possibly other NIH-approved repositories, following the guidelines outlined by the NIH for data sharing.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *The scientific data will be made findable and identifiable through the use of persistent unique identifiers (e.g., DOIs, accession numbers) and standard indexing tools available in the chosen repository.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available to other users no later than the time of an associated publication or end of the performance period, whichever comes first. Data will remain available for a minimum of 10 years after the project's completion, as per the repository's data retention policies and in compliance with NIH guidelines.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *Given that all research participants will be consented for broad data sharing, limitations on access are primarily related to protecting participant privacy and confidentiality. Data will be de-identified before sharing, and access may be controlled through dbGaP's authorized access mechanism for sensitive data.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the scientific data will be controlled through mechanisms provided by the chosen repository (e.g., dbGaP), requiring users to register and agree to terms of use before accessing sensitive or identifiable data.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect participant privacy, rights, and confidentiality, all shared data will be de-identified according to the HIPAA Privacy Rule's standards for de-identification. Additionally, the study will obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH to further safeguard against disclosure of sensitive information.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the Principal Investigator (PI) in collaboration with the institution's data management office. Regular reviews (at least annually) will ensure that data are being collected, stored, and shared according to the plan and NIH policies. The PI and designated data managers will oversee data quality control, ensure timely sharing of data through approved repositories, and address any issues or concerns related to data access or use.*
