### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *This study aims to collect renal dialysis data from multiple clinics, focusing on demographic information, laboratory results, clinical observations, and clinical disposition from 250 affected participants and 250 matched healthy controls. The estimated amount of data includes but is not limited to:  
     - Demographic data (age, sex, ethnicity, etc.) for 500 participants.  
     - Laboratory results (e.g., blood chemistry, hematology) which could generate up to 100 different metrics per participant visit, with an average of 10 visits per participant over the study period, totaling approximately 50,000 laboratory result data points.  
     - Clinical observations and clinical disposition data, which may include notes, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes, potentially generating a substantial amount of textual and categorical data.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All collected data (demographic, laboratory results, clinical observations, and clinical disposition) will be preserved and shared because it is crucial for understanding renal dialysis outcomes, improving patient care, and facilitating future research in this area. Sharing these data will enable other researchers to replicate findings, combine datasets for more powerful analyses, and explore new hypotheses that could lead to better health outcomes for patients undergoing renal dialysis.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *To facilitate interpretation of the scientific data, the following metadata and documentation will be made accessible:  
     - Study protocols outlining the methodology for data collection and analysis.  
     - Data collection instruments (e.g., questionnaires, case report forms).  
     - Data dictionaries explaining variable names, formats, and descriptions.  
     - Documentation of any data transformations or quality control processes applied to the data.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software needed to access or manipulate shared scientific data include statistical analysis packages (e.g., R, Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy) for data manipulation and analysis, and potentially data visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) for exploratory data analysis. These tools are widely available and accessible through academic licenses or open-source repositories.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*To enable interoperability of datasets and resources, common data standards will be applied to the scientific data and associated metadata. Specifically, the study will adhere to the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) standards for clinical trials data, including the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) for organizing and formatting data. These standards are widely recognized in the field of clinical research and facilitate the sharing and comparison of data across studies.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The scientific data and metadata arising from this project will be archived in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)’s National Library of Medicine (NLM) repository, specifically through the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) for genomic data or other appropriate NIH-supported repositories for non-genomic data.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *The scientific data will be made findable and identifiable through the assignment of a persistent unique identifier (e.g., DOI - Digital Object Identifier) and indexing in standard databases relevant to the field of renal dialysis research, ensuring that the data can be easily located and accessed by other researchers.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available no later than the time of publication of the main findings or within 12 months of the primary collection period ending, whichever comes first. The data will remain accessible for a minimum of 10 years after the study’s completion to allow for extended research and analysis opportunities.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *While maximizing data sharing is a priority, considerations related to participant privacy and confidentiality will be taken into account. Data will be de-identified to protect participants’ identities, in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations. Any limitations on data sharing due to these protections will be clearly documented and justified.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the scientific data will not be controlled beyond what is required for protecting human subjects’ confidentiality and adhering to NIH policies on data sharing. Data will be made available through a publicly accessible repository, with no requirement for approval or permission beyond standard repository usage agreements.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect the privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants, all shared data will be de-identified using standardized methods (e.g., removal of direct identifiers, use of coded identifiers). Additionally, a Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained from the NIH to further safeguard against disclosure of sensitive information. Participants will provide broad consent for data sharing as part of their informed consent process.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the study’s Principal Investigator (PI) in collaboration with the institution’s Research Integrity Office and Information Technology department. Regular reviews (at least annually) will be conducted to ensure adherence to the plan, including verification that data are properly archived, shared according to the timelines outlined, and that any issues related to data privacy or access are promptly addressed. The PI will be responsible for reporting any deviations from the plan to the NIH as required.*
