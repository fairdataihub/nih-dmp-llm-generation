### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *The proposed project involves collecting social, behavioral, and biological data through web-surveys, in-person interviews, and home health exams for approximately 13,000 participants (web-surveys and interviews) and 200 participants (home health exams), resulting in a substantial amount of qualitative and quantitative data.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All data collected from web-surveys, interviews, and home health exams will be preserved and shared. The rationale for sharing these data is to contribute to the broader research community, facilitate replication studies, enable meta-analyses, and foster new research questions that can advance our understanding of aging. Given that all participants are consented for broad data sharing, this maximizes the potential impact of the study.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *Metadata will include participant demographics, survey and interview protocols, home health exam procedures, and any additional information necessary to interpret the collected data correctly. Other relevant data may encompass environmental factors, lifestyle choices, and medical histories where applicable. Associated documentation will comprise study protocols, data collection instruments (e.g., survey questions), and data dictionaries explaining variable names and codes.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software needed to access or manipulate shared scientific data include statistical analysis packages like R or SPSS and potentially data visualization tools. The specific software required will be documented in the metadata to ensure that future users can appropriately analyze and interpret the data. These tools are widely available in the academic community, either through institutional licenses or free versions.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*The scientific data and associated metadata will apply common data standards to enable interoperability. Specifically, data will be formatted according to the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) standard for social science data, which is widely adopted in similar longitudinal studies. This standard ensures that data are properly described, making them understandable and usable by other researchers.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The scientific data and metadata arising from the project will be archived in the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging (NACDA), which is a repository recommended by the NIH for social science data related to aging.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Data will be made findable through the use of persistent unique identifiers (DOIs) assigned by the repository, facilitating easy citation and access. The metadata will also include standard indexing tools such as keywords and study descriptions to enhance discoverability.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available no later than the time of publication of the main findings or within one year after the completion of data collection, whichever comes first. The data will remain available for at least 10 years post-collection to allow for extensive use by the research community.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *Given that participants are consented for broad data sharing, the primary factor affecting access is ensuring that data are de-identified to protect participant privacy and confidentiality. There are no anticipated limitations on data sharing beyond standard protections for human subjects research.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the scientific data will not be controlled beyond what is required for protecting human subjects; once archived, data will be openly available through the designated repository without need for additional approval.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect participant privacy, rights, and confidentiality, all shared data will be de-identified following best practices for removing personal health information (PHI) as per HIPAA guidelines. Additionally, the study will operate under a Certificate of Confidentiality to further safeguard against disclosure of sensitive information.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the project's Principal Investigator in conjunction with the institution's data management office. Oversight will occur on a bi-annual basis, with adjustments to the plan made as necessary to ensure adherence to NIH guidelines and to reflect any changes in data sharing best practices or policies.*
