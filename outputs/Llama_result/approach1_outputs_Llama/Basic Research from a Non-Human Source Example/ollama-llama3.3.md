### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *This project aims to generate three primary datasets from mouse models of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-driven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The datasets will include:
     - Clinical and phenotypic data: This will encompass a wide range of characteristics such as animal sex, body weight, specific organ weights, age, developmental stage, tissue profiled, and disease outcome for up to 50 mice.
     - RNA sequencing datasets: These will contain normalized transcript and gene-level expression counts along with quality control metrics like total reads, clipped reads, sequencing platform, and other relevant metrics that may emerge during the project.
     - Microscopic imaging data: This will comprise light and confocal microscopy images of formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slices.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All three datasets (clinical/phenotypic, RNA sequencing, and microscopic imaging) will be preserved and shared. The rationale behind sharing these comprehensive datasets is to facilitate a deeper understanding of NASH-driven HCC, promote collaboration among researchers, and accelerate the discovery of therapeutic targets. Sharing these data aligns with the principles of transparency, reproducibility, and advancing biomedical research.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *To ensure the datasets are interpretable and usable by others, the following metadata and documentation will be made accessible:
     - Study protocols
     - Data collection instruments
     - Detailed methodologies for RNA sequencing and microscopic imaging
     - Animal housing and care conditions
     - Experimental design documents
     - Data processing and analysis pipelines*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software will be required to access or manipulate the shared scientific data. Specifically, for RNA sequencing data, tools like DESeq2, edgeR, or similar packages in R or Python will be necessary for differential gene expression analysis. For microscopic imaging data, software such as ImageJ or proprietary confocal microscopy analysis tools may be needed. These tools are widely available in the research community and can be accessed through various channels, including open-source repositories and commercial vendors.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*To ensure interoperability of datasets and resources, common data standards will be applied. For RNA sequencing data, compliance with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles will be achieved by using standardized formats like BAM for aligned reads and CSV or TSV for gene expression counts. Microscopic images will be stored in standard formats such as TIFF or JPEG2000. Clinical and phenotypic data will adhere to metadata standards recommended by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or similar authoritative bodies. If applicable, the lack of consensus standards in certain areas will be addressed through the use of community-accepted best practices.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The datasets generated from this project will be archived in the [NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) for RNA sequencing data and in a suitable repository like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash) for clinical/phenotypic data and microscopic imaging, ensuring long-term preservation and accessibility.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Each dataset will be assigned a unique and persistent identifier (e.g., DOI for Zenodo or Dryad, and GEO accession numbers for RNA sequencing data). This will enable easy location and citation of the datasets.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available no later than the time of publication of the main findings from the project or at the end of the performance period, whichever comes first. The data are expected to remain accessible for a minimum of 10 years after the project's completion to allow for long-term research utility and compliance with NIH policies.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *Since this project involves mouse models, issues related to human subject confidentiality do not apply. However, any sharing of data will be done in accordance with the terms agreed upon with any collaborators and will respect the intellectual property rights of all parties involved.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the scientific data will be open, without the need for approval, once they are deposited into the designated public repositories.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *As this project does not involve human subjects, protections for human research participant privacy, rights, and confidentiality are not applicable.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with the Data Management and Sharing Plan will be overseen by the Principal Investigator (PI) in collaboration with the institution's research data management office. Regular checks (at least semi-annually) will ensure that all project data are being properly managed, shared according to the plan, and that any issues or updates are addressed promptly. The PI will also work closely with the research team to maintain data quality, security, and accessibility throughout the project's duration and beyond.*
