### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *The project will generate a clinical dataset containing estimated kidney volumes for subjects with available imaging data within the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). The dataset is expected to include approximately [number, e.g., 1,000] records, each comprising demographic information, clinical variables, and calculated kidney volume measurements. The total size of the dataset is anticipated to be around [size, e.g., 100 MB].*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All generated clinical datasets containing estimated kidney volumes will be preserved and shared. The rationale for sharing this data is to facilitate further research into kidney health and disease, potentially leading to better understanding and management of kidney conditions. Sharing these data aligns with the principles of transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in scientific research.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *Associated metadata will include variable descriptions, data collection protocols, and imaging analysis methodologies. Other relevant data may comprise quality control measures and validation studies for the kidney volume estimation algorithm. Documentation will also include study protocols, data dictionaries, and any software or coding scripts used in data processing and analysis.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software needed to access or manipulate shared scientific data include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis software packages such as [package name, e.g., ITK-SNAP] for image segmentation and volume calculation. These tools can be accessed through their respective websites or academic licensing agreements.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*The project will apply common data standards to ensure interoperability of datasets and resources. Specifically, the clinical dataset will adhere to the [standard name, e.g., HL7 FHIR] standard for electronic health records and the [standard name, e.g., DICOM] standard for medical imaging data. These standards will facilitate data sharing and integration across different research platforms and studies.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The clinical dataset and associated metadata will be archived in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)’s database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), ensuring compliance with NIH policies on data sharing.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Data will be made findable through a persistent unique identifier, such as a DOI (Digital Object Identifier), and indexed in the dbGaP catalog using standardized keywords and descriptors related to kidney volume analysis and MRI imaging.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The dataset will be made available no later than the time of publication of the primary results or at the end of the performance period, whichever comes first. The data will remain accessible for a minimum of 10 years following the completion of the project to allow for extended research and validation studies.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *Given that all participants are consented for broad data sharing, there are no anticipated limitations on access, distribution, or reuse beyond standard protections for privacy and confidentiality. However, any use of the data must comply with the terms of use specified by dbGaP and respect the rights and privacy of the research participants.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the dataset will be controlled through the dbGaP authorized access mechanism, requiring users to register and agree to the terms of use before downloading the data.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect participant privacy, rights, and confidentiality, all shared data will be de-identified in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines. Furthermore, the project will obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH to provide additional legal protection against compelled disclosure of identifiable research information.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the Principal Investigator (PI), in collaboration with the institution’s research data management office. Regular oversight meetings will be conducted every six months to review data sharing progress, address any issues related to data access or use, and ensure that all shared data are properly documented and de-identified. The PI will also be responsible for reporting any updates or changes to the data sharing plan to the NIH as required.*
