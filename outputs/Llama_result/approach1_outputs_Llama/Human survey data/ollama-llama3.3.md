### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *The study anticipates generating a significant amount of data from survey interviews with 2,500 children aged 8-17 years and 1,500 primary caregivers, as well as child time diaries. This will include raw interview data, recoded data for missing values or top coding, scale composites, and individual-level links to detailed school data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and contextual data based on geocodes for family residences.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All collected data, including survey responses, time diaries, recoded datasets, scale composites, and linked school and contextual data, will be preserved and shared. The rationale is to provide a comprehensive, nationally representative dataset on children aged 8-17 and their primary caregivers, facilitating future research on child development, education outcomes, and health.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *Associated metadata will include participant demographics, survey and diary collection protocols, data cleaning and recoding procedures, and documentation of how scale composites were constructed. Study protocols, consent forms, and data collection instruments will also be made accessible to facilitate interpretation and potential replication of the study findings.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software needed for data analysis include statistical packages like R or SPSS for survey data analysis and GIS software for geocode-based contextual data analysis. Specific code used for recoding, constructing scale composites, and linking datasets will be documented and shared through repositories like GitHub to ensure transparency and reproducibility.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*The project will apply common data standards for demographic, educational, and health data to enable interoperability with other national datasets. Specifically, data will be formatted according to the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) standards for social science data, ensuring that metadata is comprehensive and facilitates understanding and reuse of the dataset. For geospatial data, standards from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) will be used.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The scientific data and associated metadata will be archived in a trusted repository such as the ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research) or the National Archive of Child Health and Human Development, ensuring long-term preservation and accessibility.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Data will be made findable through DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) assigned by the repository and indexed in major search engines and academic databases, facilitating easy discovery and access.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *Scientific data will be made available no later than the time of publication of the main findings or within 12 months of the project's completion, whichever comes first. The data will remain accessible for at least 10 years after the initial release to allow for extensive use by the research community.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *Given that all participants are consented for broad data sharing, limitations on access will primarily be related to protecting participant privacy and confidentiality, adhering to IRB-approved protocols, and complying with federal regulations regarding human subjects research.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to identifiable data will be controlled through a data use agreement that requires users to agree not to attempt to identify participants or breach confidentiality. De-identified data will be openly accessible without restriction.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect participant privacy, all shared datasets will be de-identified, removing direct identifiers and applying statistical methods to prevent re-identification. Certificates of Confidentiality will be obtained from the NIH to further safeguard sensitive information.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored by the project's Principal Investigator (PI) in collaboration with the institution's data management office. Regular oversight meetings will occur every six months to review data collection progress, ensure adherence to sharing timelines, and address any issues related to data privacy or accessibility. The PI will also work closely with the IRB to ensure that all data sharing practices comply with ethical standards and federal regulations.*
