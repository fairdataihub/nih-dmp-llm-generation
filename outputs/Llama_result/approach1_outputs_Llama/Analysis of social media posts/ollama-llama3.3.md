### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *The proposed study is expected to generate several types of scientific data, including: 
     - Approximately 300,000 publicly available social media posts (including images and videos) with associated comments.
     - Quantitative survey data from 500 young adult participants (age 18-34).
     - User analytics such as views, comments, and shares from the intervention delivered via Instagram.
   The total estimated amount of data is substantial, given the volume of social media posts, survey responses, and user analytics metrics.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All collected scientific data (social media posts with comments, survey data, and user analytics) will be preserved and shared because they are essential for understanding the impact of social media on young adults' perceptions and behaviors related to cancer. Sharing these data will enable other researchers to replicate findings, conduct secondary analyses, and advance our understanding of how social media influences health outcomes.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *The following metadata and documentation will be made accessible:
     - Study protocols.
     - Data collection instruments (e.g., survey questions).
     - Data dictionaries describing variable names, definitions, and codes used for categorizing social media posts.
     - Documentation of data processing steps, including how identifiers were removed and how missing values were handled.
     - Intervention group assignments for participants.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software are needed to access or manipulate the shared scientific data. Specifically, tools for data mining (for social media posts), statistical analysis software (e.g., R, SPSS, SAS) for survey data and user analytics, and potentially machine learning libraries for sentiment analysis or topic modeling of social media content. These tools can be accessed through academic licenses or open-source repositories.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*To enable interoperability, the following common data standards will be applied:
     - For social media posts, a standardized schema for metadata (e.g., date posted, engagement metrics) and content analysis (e.g., sentiment, topic codes).
     - For survey data, adherence to Questionnaire Design principles and use of standardized demographic categories.
     - For user analytics, metrics will follow the standards set by the social media platform (Instagram) for views, comments, shares, etc.
   These standards facilitate comparison across datasets and ensure that the scientific community can easily understand and build upon the research findings.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The scientific data and associated metadata arising from this project will be archived in the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) or a similar NIH-approved repository that aligns with the data types collected.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Scientific data will be made findable through the use of persistent unique identifiers (e.g., DOIs for datasets, publications) and standard indexing tools such as PubMed for publications resulting from the data analysis.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available no later than the time of publication of the main findings or at the end of the performance period, whichever comes first. Data will remain available indefinitely through the chosen repository, in accordance with NIH policies on data sharing.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *The primary factor affecting access is the protection of human subjects' privacy and confidentiality. Given that all data will be deidentified and participants have consented to broad data sharing, no additional limitations on access are anticipated beyond those standard protections for human subject research.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the scientific data will not be controlled beyond the standard measures applied by the repository for ensuring that users agree to terms of use that respect privacy and confidentiality protections.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect the privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:
     - All identifying information (names, social media handles) will be removed from social media posts and comments.
     - Survey data and user analytics will be deidentified upon collection.
     - The study has obtained or will obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality to further protect sensitive information.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the Principal Investigator (PI) in collaboration with the data manager and other key personnel. Regular checks (every 6 months) will ensure that data are being properly collected, stored, and prepared for sharing according to the plan. The PI is responsible for reporting any issues or deviations from the plan to the NIH and for ensuring that all team members understand their roles in data management and sharing.*
