### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *This study aims to collect demographic and clinical data from 200 amyloid-positive, cognitively normal older adults with symptomatic insomnia. The types of clinical data include amyloid-beta (Aβ), tau, phosphorylated tau, NPTX2, sTREM2, and NfL from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); Aβ, tau, and phosphorylated tau from plasma; and cognitive status assessments. We anticipate generating approximately 200 datasets for each type of clinical data, along with associated demographic information.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All collected scientific data, including demographic information, CSF and plasma biomarkers, and cognitive assessments, will be preserved and shared. The rationale for sharing these data is to facilitate research into the relationship between amyloid positivity, insomnia, and cognitive decline in older adults, thereby advancing our understanding of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *Metadata will include participant identifiers, age, sex, and collection dates for each sample. Other relevant data will encompass study protocols, data collection instruments (e.g., questionnaires, cognitive tests), and analytical methods used to process biomarker samples. Associated documentation will be made accessible to facilitate interpretation of the scientific data.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software needed to access or manipulate shared scientific data include statistical analysis packages (e.g., R, Python libraries) for handling large datasets and specific algorithms for biomarker analysis. These tools are widely available in the academic community.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*Common data standards applied to the scientific data and associated metadata will include those recommended by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) for Alzheimer's disease research, such as the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) protocols for biomarker collection and analysis. These standards enable interoperability of datasets and resources.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *Scientific data and metadata arising from the project will be archived in the National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer’s Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) or a similar designated repository that aligns with NIH guidelines for data sharing.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *The scientific data will be made findable and identifiable via persistent unique identifiers (e.g., DOI numbers) and standard indexing tools compatible with the chosen repository, ensuring ease of access for other researchers.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available to other users no later than the time of an associated publication or end of the performance period, whichever comes first, and will remain available for at least 10 years following the completion of the project to maximize its utility for the research community.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *Given that all participants will provide consent for broad data sharing, factors affecting access are minimal. However, protections for privacy and confidentiality will be maintained through de-identification of datasets before sharing.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the scientific data will not be controlled beyond the standard protocols of the repository used for archiving, which may include registration or acceptance of terms of use.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect the privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants, all shared data will be de-identified. Additionally, a Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained to further safeguard against disclosure of sensitive information.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the Principal Investigator (PI) in collaboration with the institution's data management office. Regular checks (at least annually) will ensure that data are being properly collected, stored, and shared according to the plan and NIH guidelines. The PI will also be responsible for reporting any deviations from the plan to the funding agency.*
