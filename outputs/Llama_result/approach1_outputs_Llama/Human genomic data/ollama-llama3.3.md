### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *The proposed research project is anticipated to generate a substantial amount of genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data. The dataset will include array-derived genotype data from approximately 1,000 human participants (500 cases and 500 controls), 30x whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data for the same cohort, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to analyze gene expression profiles, Hi-C WGS data for 3D genomic structure information, phenotypic and clinical data from institutional electronic health records (EHRs), and demographic data including age, sex, ethnicity, among others. The estimated volume of data will be significant, with each type of sequencing data contributing hundreds of gigabytes per participant.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All types of scientific data generated in this project (genomic, transcriptomic, clinical, and demographic) will be preserved and shared. The rationale behind sharing these data is to contribute meaningfully to the scientific community by providing comprehensive insights into genomic structure, gene expression, and their correlations with clinical outcomes. This data sharing will facilitate further research, validation of findings, and potential discovery of novel therapeutic targets or biomarkers.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *To facilitate the interpretation and reuse of shared scientific data, metadata such as sample identifiers, sequencing library preparation methods, and data processing pipelines will be made accessible. Other relevant data include participant consent forms, study protocols, and detailed descriptions of clinical and demographic variables extracted from EHRs. Associated documentation, like data collection instruments and analytical software versions, will also be provided.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software are required to access and manipulate the shared scientific data. Key tools include but are not limited to Illumina sequencing analysis software for primary data processing, Bioconductor packages in R for RNA-seq analysis, and HiC-Pro for Hi-C data processing. Access to these tools can be obtained through their respective official websites or repositories (e.g., CRAN for R packages).*

### Element 3: Standards:
*To ensure interoperability of datasets and resources, common data standards will be applied. For genomic and transcriptomic data, the FASTQ and BAM formats will be used. Clinical and demographic data will adhere to standardized vocabulary and coding systems such as SNOMED-CT and ICD-10 for clinical terms and ethnicity/race categorizations based on NIH guidelines. Metadata will follow the MINSEQE guidelines for sequencing experiments. If applicable, adherence to emerging standards in 3D genomic structure analysis (e.g., Hi-C data) will be considered.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The scientific data and associated metadata from this project will be archived in the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), a repository that allows for controlled access to genomic data from human participants, ensuring compliance with NIH policies on sharing human data.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Data will be made findable through the use of persistent unique identifiers such as dbGaP study accession numbers and DOI (Digital Object Identifier) links for associated publications. Standard indexing tools like PubMed and Google Dataset Search will also facilitate discoverability.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available no later than the time of publication of the main findings or at the end of the performance period, whichever comes first. Data will remain accessible for a minimum of 10 years after the project's completion to allow for extensive use by the research community.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *While maximizing data sharing is a priority, factors such as informed consent limitations and protecting participant privacy and confidentiality will be considered. Given that all participants are consented for broad data sharing, the primary limitation will be ensuring de-identification of clinical and demographic data to prevent re-identification risks.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to certain datasets, particularly those containing potentially identifiable human information, will be controlled through dbGaP's authorization process, requiring users to register and agree to terms of use that protect participant confidentiality.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect the privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants, all shared data will undergo rigorous de-identification processes, removing direct identifiers and applying methods to minimize re-identification risks (e.g., aggregating certain variables). Furthermore, a Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained from NIH to provide additional legal protections against compelled disclosure of identifiable information.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the institution's data management oversight committee, which includes representatives from the research team, the Office of Research Compliance, and the Library's Data Services. Regular reviews (at least bi-annually) will ensure adherence to the plan, address any emerging issues or changes in policies, and confirm that all shared data are properly documented and accessible according to the stated timelines.*
