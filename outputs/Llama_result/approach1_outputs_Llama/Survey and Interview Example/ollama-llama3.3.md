### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *This study aims to collect quantitative and qualitative survey data from 3,000 U.S. adults, including 40-50 fixed-scale and open-ended text items. Additionally, it will conduct digitally recorded semi-structured interviews with patients (n=40), healthcare providers (n=40), and industry professionals (n=20). The estimated amount of scientific data generated includes raw and recoded survey data, deidentified interview transcripts, codebooks, and coding summary files.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All collected data, including survey responses and interview transcripts, will be preserved and shared to facilitate future research, maximize the utility of the data, and enhance reproducibility. The rationale is to contribute meaningfully to the scientific community by making comprehensive datasets available for secondary analyses, thus promoting further investigations into the topics studied.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *Metadata will include participant demographics, survey and interview protocols, data collection instruments (e.g., questionnaires), codebooks for qualitative data analysis, and detailed descriptions of recoding processes for quantitative data. Associated documentation will comprise study protocols, informed consent forms, and data management plans to ensure transparency and facilitate the interpretation of shared scientific data.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software needed for data analysis include statistical packages (e.g., R, SPSS) for quantitative data and qualitative analysis software (e.g., NVivo, Atlas.ti) for coding and analyzing interview transcripts. These tools are widely available in academic settings or can be accessed through institutional licenses, ensuring that other researchers can manipulate and analyze the shared data.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*Common data standards to be applied include those recommended by the NIH for human subjects research, such as the use of standardized vocabularies and ontologies (e.g., PhenX toolkit measures) for enhancing data comparability and interoperability. Data will be structured in formats compliant with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), facilitating easy discovery and integration with other datasets.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The scientific data and metadata arising from this project will be archived in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database or another NIH-approved repository that aligns with the study’s focus on genomic research and human subjects, ensuring broad accessibility and long-term preservation.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Data will be made findable through the use of persistent unique identifiers (e.g., DOIs) and standard indexing tools, allowing for easy location and access by other researchers.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *Scientific data will be made available no later than the time of publication of the main findings or at the end of the performance period, whichever comes first. Data will remain accessible for a minimum of 10 years after the project’s completion to allow for extended research and analysis opportunities.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *Given that all participants will provide consent for broad data sharing, limitations on access will primarily be related to protecting participant privacy and confidentiality. Measures such as deidentification of datasets and removal of personally identifiable information will be taken to mitigate these risks.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the shared scientific data will not be controlled beyond what is required for protecting human subject privacy and ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations, such as HIPAA.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect participant privacy, all data will be deidentified, and open-ended text items will be reviewed for potential privacy disclosure risks and redacted as necessary. Additionally, the use of Certificates of Confidentiality will be explored to further safeguard sensitive information.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the study’s Principal Investigator in conjunction with the institutional data management office. Regular checks (every six months) will ensure that data collection, storage, and sharing practices adhere to the outlined plan, facilitating timely corrections if deviations occur. Oversight responsibilities include ensuring data quality, maintaining documentation of data sharing activities, and coordinating with the repository for data archiving.*
