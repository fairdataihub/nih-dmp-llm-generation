### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *Our genomic study aims to generate raw whole genome sequencing data and derived data from approximately 500 research subjects. Additionally, we will collect extensive phenotypic and clinical data using standardized data dictionaries provided by the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA). The estimated amount of data includes over 1 terabyte of genomic data and thousands of data points related to phenotypic and clinical information.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All raw whole genome sequencing data, derived genomic data, and associated phenotypic and clinical data collected from research participants will be preserved and shared through dbGaP and NDA. The rationale for this decision is to contribute significantly to the understanding of mental health disorders by making these valuable datasets available to the broader scientific community, facilitating collaborative research, replication studies, and accelerating discovery.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *To facilitate interpretation and reuse of our scientific data, we will make accessible comprehensive metadata including but not limited to: study protocols, data collection instruments, informed consent documents, and detailed descriptions of the genomic and phenotypic/clinical data collection processes. Additionally, data dictionaries used for organizing and structuring the phenotypic and clinical data will be shared through NDA.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software such as those used for whole genome sequencing analysis (e.g., BWA, GATK) and data manipulation (e.g., Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy) will be necessary to access or manipulate shared scientific data. These tools are widely available in the scientific community and can be accessed through their respective official websites or repositories (e.g., GitHub).*

### Element 3: Standards:
*To enable interoperability of datasets, we will apply common data standards for genomic data as recommended by dbGaP and for phenotypic/clinical data as specified by NDA. Specifically, we will adhere to the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature guidelines for genomic variations and utilize standardized vocabularies and ontologies endorsed by NDA for clinical and phenotypic data. This application of standardized formats ensures that our datasets can be easily integrated with other studies, promoting comparative analyses and collaborative research.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The raw whole genome sequencing data and derived genomic data will be submitted to dbGaP, while the phenotypic and clinical data along with associated metadata will be deposited into the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA). Both repositories are recognized by NIH for archiving and sharing scientific data.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Each dataset will be assigned a unique identifier by dbGaP and NDA upon submission, ensuring that our scientific data can be easily located and accessed through these repositories. Furthermore, we will utilize standard indexing tools and keywords to enhance the discoverability of our datasets.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *In accordance with NIH policies, our scientific data will be made available no later than the time of publication of the main findings or at the end of the performance period, whichever comes first. The data will remain accessible through dbGaP and NDA for a minimum of 10 years after the project's completion to allow for extended research and analysis opportunities.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *Given that all research participants will provide broad consent for data sharing, the primary factors affecting subsequent access will be related to ensuring compliance with NIH guidelines and protecting participant privacy. There are no anticipated limitations on data sharing beyond standard protections for human subjects' confidentiality.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to our datasets through dbGaP and NDA may involve a controlled-access process, where researchers must apply and justify their intended use of the data before being granted access. This is particularly relevant for sensitive human subject data and ensures that data are used responsibly and ethically.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To safeguard the privacy, rights, and confidentiality of our research participants, we will implement rigorous de-identification procedures for all shared data. Additionally, we will obtain Certificates of Confidentiality from NIH to further protect against compelled disclosure of identifiable information. All personnel involved in the project will undergo training on human subjects' protection and confidentiality.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored by our institution's Data Management Oversight Committee, which includes representatives from our research team, the Office of Research Administration, and the Institutional Review Board (IRB). This committee will meet quarterly to review progress in data collection, sharing, and protection of human subjects' information. The Principal Investigator will be responsible for ensuring that all aspects of the Plan are implemented as described and for reporting any deviations or issues to the oversight committee.*
