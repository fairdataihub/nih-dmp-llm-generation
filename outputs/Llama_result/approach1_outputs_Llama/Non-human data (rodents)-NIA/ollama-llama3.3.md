### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *The study will generate multimodal data from 50 to 80 mouse subjects, combining electrophysiological, behavioral, and imaging modalities. The expected data types include:
     - Electrophysiology data: Raw extracellular voltage recordings and processed spike time data, estimated at 100–1000 GB.
     - Behavioral data: Raw video frames and processed positional and heading data for spatial navigation tasks, estimated at 10–100 GB.
     - Imaging data: 3-color image stacks of immunostained mouse brain tissue from confocal microscopy, verifying probe placement in the hippocampus, estimated at 1–10 GB.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All generated data (electrophysiology, behavioral, and imaging) will be preserved and shared. The rationale is to facilitate transparency, reproducibility, and further research into hippocampal function, potentially leading to advancements in understanding neurological disorders and aging processes.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *Metadata will include experimental protocols, animal subject information (age, sex, strain), electrode placement coordinates, and behavioral task descriptions. Other relevant data will encompass environmental conditions during experiments (temperature, humidity) and equipment settings (microscope, recording devices). Associated documentation will include study protocols, data collection instruments, and detailed methodologies for data processing and analysis.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software needed to access or manipulate shared scientific data include:
     - Electrophysiology analysis software (e.g., Spike2, MATLAB).
     - Video analysis software for behavioral data (e.g., ANY-maze, EthoVision).
     - Image processing software for microscopy images (e.g., ImageJ, Fiji).
   These tools can be accessed through their respective websites or academic licensing agreements.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*Common data standards to be applied include:
     - Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) for electrophysiology and behavioral data.
     - Open Microscopy Environment (OME) for imaging data.
   These standards enable interoperability of datasets, facilitating collaborative research and data reuse. For metadata, we will adhere to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), ensuring that our data is properly described, licensed, and accessible.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *Scientific data and metadata will be archived in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Data Archive (NDA), which is compatible with the standards mentioned above and allows for controlled access to sensitive data.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Data will be made findable through the use of persistent unique identifiers (DOIs) assigned by the repository, along with detailed metadata descriptions and standardized keywords facilitating discovery.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *Scientific data will be made available no later than the time of publication of the main findings or end of the performance period, whichever comes first. Data will remain accessible for a minimum of 10 years following the end of the project to allow for extended research and validation opportunities.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *Given that our study involves animal subjects rather than human participants, factors affecting access are primarily related to ensuring the integrity and security of the data during sharing and storage. No limitations based on informed consent or privacy concerns are applicable.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to certain aspects of the data, particularly detailed experimental protocols and raw data files, may be controlled through the NDA's access request mechanism to ensure that data are used appropriately and respectfully.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *As this project involves mouse subjects, protections for human participant privacy, rights, and confidentiality are not applicable. However, all experiments will be conducted in accordance with institutional animal care and use guidelines to ensure ethical treatment of animals.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the Principal Investigator (PI) and a designated data manager. Regular oversight meetings will occur quarterly to review data generation, storage, and sharing processes. The institution's research integrity office will also conduct annual reviews to ensure adherence to the plan and address any issues or updates as necessary.*
