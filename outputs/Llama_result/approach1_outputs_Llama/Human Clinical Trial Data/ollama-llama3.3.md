### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *The proposed study is expected to generate a significant amount of clinical, laboratory, and imaging data from approximately 360 participants (180 mother-infant pairs) across three sites. Clinical data will include medical history, demographic information, patient characteristics, lab tests, physical exams, blood pressure measurements, fetal monitoring assessments, and pregnancy outcomes. Laboratory data will comprise results from urinalysis, analysis of angiogenic factors, uric acid, glycemia, and other research-specific tests. Imaging data will consist of 2D Doppler studies of uterine, umbilical, and middle cerebral arteries; 3D images of the fetal thigh for volume measurements; and real-time grayscale 2D clips of the fetal heart. This data will be collected at enrollment, during antepartum management, at delivery, and through infant follow-up visits at 3, 6, and 12 months of age.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All clinical, laboratory, and imaging data collected throughout the study will be preserved and shared to facilitate future research into early onset preeclampsia, improve antepartum management strategies, enhance neonatal outcomes, and contribute to the understanding of maternal and fetal health. Sharing these data will enable other researchers to replicate findings, conduct meta-analyses, and explore new hypotheses that could lead to better prevention and treatment options for preeclampsia.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *Associated metadata will include participant IDs, visit dates, types of measurements taken (e.g., blood pressure, lab tests), imaging protocols used, and outcomes assessed (e.g., days of maintaining pregnancy, neonatal health metrics). Other relevant data will encompass study protocols, informed consent documents, data collection instruments, and detailed descriptions of analytical methods used for laboratory and imaging assessments. These will be made accessible to ensure transparency, facilitate interpretation of the scientific data, and enable reproducibility.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software needed to access or manipulate shared scientific data include REDCap for clinical and laboratory data management, and specific imaging analysis software (e.g., DICOM viewers for cardiac clips, proprietary software for 3D image analysis of fetal thigh volumes). Details on accessing these tools will be provided in the data sharing plan appendix.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*Common data standards to be applied include those recommended by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for clinical and laboratory data, such as the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) standards for clinical trials data. For imaging data, standards will follow the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format for medical images. These standards will enable interoperability and facilitate the combination of datasets from different studies.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The scientific data and associated metadata arising from this project will be archived in a NIH-approved repository, such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or other appropriate repositories designated by the NIH for specific data types (e.g., imaging data in the Cancer Imaging Archive).*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Scientific data will be made findable through the use of persistent unique identifiers, such as DOI numbers for datasets and publications, and standard indexing tools like those used by PubMed and clinical trial registries.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available to other users no later than the time of publication of the main findings or within one year after the completion of data collection, whichever comes first, in accordance with NIH policies. Data will be available for at least 10 years following the completion of the study to allow sufficient time for secondary analyses and replication studies.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *Access to identifiable private information will be restricted due to privacy concerns, but de-identified data will be made broadly available. Limitations may also apply based on the terms of informed consent and any Certificates of Confidentiality obtained to protect participant identities.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to certain datasets, particularly those containing identifiable or sensitive information, may require approval from a data access committee or be controlled through a data repository that reviews requests for data access.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect the privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants, all shared data will be de-identified according to HIPAA guidelines, and participants will provide consent for broad sharing of their data. Additional protections may include Certificates of Confidentiality to further safeguard against disclosure of sensitive information.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the study's principal investigator in collaboration with the institution's research administration office. Regular oversight meetings will occur quarterly during the active data collection phase and annually thereafter to ensure adherence to the plan, address any issues related to data sharing, and implement necessary updates as policies evolve.*
