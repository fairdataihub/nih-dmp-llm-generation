### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *The proposed secondary analysis of publicly available datasets will generate several types of scientific data, including but not limited to, processed imaging data (BOLD signal, DTI indices such as fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, mean diffusivity), WM/GM connectivity maps derived from Fluorescence Optical Imaging (FOI) atlases in NIFTI format, and statistical analysis results comparing local anisotropic correlation of the BOLD signal and DTI indices between subjects with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and those without AD. The estimated amount of data includes imaging datasets for 2,000 subjects (1,000 with AD and 1,000 without AD), which will be approximately 10 TB in size considering the high-resolution nature of MR and PET scans.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All processed imaging data, statistical analysis results, and derived WM/GM connectivity maps will be preserved and shared. The rationale is to provide the research community with comprehensive datasets that can enhance understanding of white matter circuits in normal aging and AD, facilitate replication studies, and foster new investigations into the pathophysiology of AD.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *Associated metadata will include subject demographics (age, sex), clinical and cognitive assessment scores, APOE status, and imaging protocol details. Other relevant data will comprise study protocols, data collection instruments, and detailed methodologies for image processing and statistical analyses. These will be made accessible to facilitate interpretation of the scientific data and ensure transparency and reproducibility.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software needed to access or manipulate shared scientific data include FSL (FMRIB Software Library) for DTI analysis, AFNI (Analysis of Functional NeuroImages) for BOLD signal processing, and 3D Slicer for visualization and segmentation of imaging data. These tools are widely used in the neuroimaging community and can be accessed freely or through institutional licenses.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*Common data standards to be applied include the NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) format for imaging data, ensuring interoperability across different analysis platforms. For metadata, standards such as those recommended by the NIH-funded Biomedical Data Sharing Workgroup will be followed, facilitating consistent description and annotation of datasets.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The scientific data and associated metadata will be archived in the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) repository, specifically through the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database for neuroimaging data, ensuring broad accessibility and long-term preservation.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Data will be made findable and identifiable through the use of persistent unique identifiers (e.g., DOIs - Digital Object Identifiers), standard indexing tools, and detailed metadata descriptions uploaded to the repository and linked to relevant publications.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available no later than the time of publication of the primary results or within 12 months of the project’s completion, whichever comes first. Data will remain accessible for a minimum of 10 years after the project’s completion to accommodate potential future research needs and replication studies.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *Given that all subjects have provided consent for broad data sharing, there are no anticipated limitations on access, distribution, or reuse beyond standard expectations for appropriate use in research contexts and compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding human subject research.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the scientific data will not be controlled; once archived, data will be openly accessible without need for approval, aligning with principles of open science and maximizing the potential benefits of data sharing.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *Although the primary datasets are publicly available and de-identified, any additional metadata or results that could potentially reveal subject identities will be protected through secure storage and access controls. De-identification procedures will follow HIPAA guidelines to ensure the privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants are maintained.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the Principal Investigator (PI) in collaboration with the institution’s Research Data Management Office. Regular oversight meetings will occur bi-annually to review data management practices, ensure adherence to the sharing plan, address any challenges or updates in data standards or policies, and maintain accurate records of data sharing activities.*
