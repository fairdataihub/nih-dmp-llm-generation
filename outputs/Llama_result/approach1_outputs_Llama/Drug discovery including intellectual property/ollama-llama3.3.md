### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *The project is estimated to generate a significant amount of scientific data, including: 
     - Design, production, characterization, and purification protocols for 30 Compound A analogs.
     - In vitro and cell-based assay data for 30 Compound A analogs.
     - Substance stability data, in vitro toxicology data, and in vivo toxicology data (using 6 WT mice per dose, with 5 doses) for 10 selected compounds.
     - Pharmacokinetics (ADME) data for 3-4 compounds (using 10 5xFAD mice per dose, with 4 doses).
     - Preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data for 2-3 compounds (using 15 WT or 5xFAD mice per compound).*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All scientific data generated from this project will be preserved and shared. The rationale is to facilitate transparency, reproducibility, and accelerated discovery in the field of aging research. Sharing these data will enable other researchers to build upon our findings, validate our results, and explore new hypotheses related to Compound A analogs.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *The following metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation will be made accessible:
     - Study protocols
     - Data collection instruments
     - compound characterization data (e.g., structure, purity)
     - Assay descriptions and results
     - PET imaging protocols and analysis methods
     - Mouse strain and breeding information
     - Dose response curves for toxicology studies*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software needed to access or manipulate shared scientific data include:
     - GraphPad Prism for dose-response curve analysis
     - ImageJ for PET imaging analysis
     - ChemDraw for chemical structure drawing and editing
     - These tools are widely used in the field and can be accessed through institutional licenses or free versions.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*The following common data standards will be applied to ensure interoperability of datasets and resources:
     - MIABE (Minimum Information About a Bioactive Entity) for compound characterization
     - MIACA (Minimum Information About a Cellular Assay) for in vitro assay data
     - ToxML for toxicology data reporting
     - These standards are recognized within the biomedical research community and will facilitate comparison and integration of our data with existing datasets.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines

1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *Scientific data and metadata arising from this project will be archived in publicly accessible repositories such as:
     - PubChem for compound structures and assay data
     - Figshare or Zenodo for other types of data (e.g., PET images, toxicology reports)
     - These repositories are recognized by the NIH and provide long-term preservation and access to scientific data.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Scientific data will be made findable and identifiable through:
     - Assignment of DOI (Digital Object Identifiers) for each dataset
     - Use of standardized keywords and ontology terms in metadata descriptions
     - Indexing in relevant databases and search engines*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *Scientific data will be made available no later than the time of publication of the associated manuscript or within 12 months of the project end date, whichever comes first. Data will remain accessible for a minimum of 10 years after the project completion to ensure their continued utility and accessibility to the research community.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations

1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *The primary factor affecting access is ensuring that all shared data are properly de-identified to protect animal welfare and research participant confidentiality. Additionally, considerations related to intellectual property may apply for certain compound structures and associated protocols.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the scientific data will not be controlled beyond standard repository access controls (e.g., login requirements for some datasets). However, for sensitive or potentially patentable information, a embargo period may be applied prior to public release.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *Although this project primarily involves animal models, any future studies involving human subjects will adhere strictly to guidelines protecting participant privacy, rights, and confidentiality, including but not limited to obtaining informed consent, using de-identification methods where applicable, and applying for Certificates of Confidentiality as necessary.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Plan will be monitored and managed by the Principal Investigator (PI) in collaboration with the research institution’s data management office. Regular checks (every 6 months) will be performed to ensure that all generated data are properly documented, stored, and shared according to the outlined timeline and standards. The PI will also oversee the preparation of Data Management and Sharing reports as required by the NIH.*
