### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *This project anticipates generating several types of scientific data, including physical activity data from accelerometers, survey responses characterizing caregiver well-being, and digital recordings of participant responses to semi-structured interviews. The estimated amount of data includes accelerometer readings for 250 participants across three timepoints, survey responses from the same cohort, and approximately 250 digital recordings of interviews, each expected to be about 60 minutes long.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All scientific data generated from this project, including physical activity data, survey responses, and interview recordings (in de-identified form), will be preserved and shared. The rationale for sharing these data is to facilitate secondary analyses, promote transparency and reproducibility in research, and enable other researchers to build upon our findings, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of caregiver well-being and its relationship with physical activity.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *To facilitate interpretation of the scientific data, we will make accessible metadata such as participant demographics, data collection protocols, survey instruments, interview guides, and detailed descriptions of the accelerometer data collection procedures. Associated documentation will include study protocols, informed consent forms, and data dictionaries.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software needed to access or manipulate shared scientific data include statistical analysis packages (e.g., R, SPSS) for survey and accelerometer data, and transcription software (e.g., NVivo) for analyzing interview recordings. These tools are widely available in the academic community, and specific versions used will be documented in our methodology descriptions.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*Common data standards applied to the scientific data and associated metadata will include those recommended by the NIH for physical activity measurement and survey research, as well as standards for qualitative data such as those outlined by the Qualitative Data Repository. For accelerometer data, we will adhere to the standards set by the National Cancer Institute's Physical Activity Measurement Guidelines. Survey data will be formatted according to the Questionnaire Design guidelines. Since no single consensus standard exists for all types of data collected in this project (especially qualitative interview data), we will follow best practices in the field and ensure that our metadata and documentation are comprehensive and transparent.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *Scientific data and metadata arising from this project will be archived in a public repository such as the National Institutes of Health’s National Library of Medicine (NLM) or other NIH-approved repositories like the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) for social science data, ensuring long-term preservation and access.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *The scientific data will be made findable and identifiable through the use of persistent unique identifiers such as DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers), which will be assigned upon deposition into the chosen repository. Data will also be indexed using standard keywords and descriptors relevant to caregiver well-being, physical activity, and aging research.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available no later than the time of publication of the main findings or at the end of the performance period, whichever comes first. The data are expected to remain accessible for a minimum of 10 years after the project’s completion, as per NIH guidelines and repository policies, to allow for long-term research and analysis.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *While we aim to maximize data sharing, factors such as participant privacy and confidentiality may limit certain aspects of data accessibility. All participants will provide broad consent for data sharing, but measures will be taken to de-identify data, especially for sensitive information shared during interviews.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the scientific data will not be controlled beyond what is required for protecting participant privacy and confidentiality. Once deposited in a public repository, data will be available for download and use by other researchers without need for approval, except where specified by repository policies.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect the privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants, all identifiable information will be removed from shared datasets (de-identification). We will also obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH to further safeguard against disclosure of sensitive information. Informed consent documents will clearly outline the risks and benefits of data sharing.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the Principal Investigator (PI) in collaboration with the research team, including a designated data manager. Regular checks (every 6 months) will ensure that data collection, storage, and sharing practices adhere to the outlined plan and relevant regulations. The institution’s Office of Research Compliance and Integrity will also provide oversight and support as needed to ensure adherence to NIH policies and ethical standards.*
