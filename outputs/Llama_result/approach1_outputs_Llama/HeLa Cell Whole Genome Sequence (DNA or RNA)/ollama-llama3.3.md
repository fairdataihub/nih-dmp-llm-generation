### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *The project aims to generate high-fidelity (HiFi) long-read whole-genome sequencing data from a single human HeLa cell line. The total expected data output is approximately 700 megabytes (MB), which will capture the complete genome of the HeLa cell line with high-resolution coverage. The sequencing will be performed using the PacBio platform, known for its high-accuracy long reads suitable for resolving complex genomic regions.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All generated whole-genome sequencing data will be preserved and shared. The rationale behind this decision is to contribute to the scientific community's understanding of the HeLa cell line's genome, facilitating future research and potentially leading to breakthroughs in fields such as cancer biology and genomic medicine. Sharing these data aligns with the principles of transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration that underpin modern biomedical research.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *Associated metadata will include sequencing protocols, sample preparation methods, and data analysis pipelines used in the project. Other relevant data may encompass quality control metrics for the sequencing runs and any additional experimental data that provide context to the genomic findings. Documentation such as study protocols, consent forms (given that this proposal involves human participants who have been consented for broad data sharing), and detailed descriptions of bioinformatic tools and parameters used will also be made accessible.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software needed to access or manipulate the shared scientific data include but are not limited to PacBio's SMRT Link for initial data processing, and potentially other bioinformatics packages like SAMtools and BWA for alignment and variant calling. These tools are widely used in the genomics community and can be accessed through their respective official websites or through containerization platforms like Docker.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*The project will apply common data standards to ensure interoperability of datasets. For genomic data, standards such as those provided by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) will be followed. Specifically, data will be formatted according to the SAM/BAM specification for aligned sequences and VCF for variant calls. Metadata will adhere to the MINSEQE guidelines where applicable, ensuring that all experimental and analytical processes are thoroughly documented and accessible.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The scientific data and associated metadata arising from this project will be archived in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, specifically through the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) for raw sequencing data and potentially dbGaP or equivalent repositories for analyzed data, depending on the sensitivity and type of data generated.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Scientific data will be made findable and identifiable via accession numbers provided by the repository where the data are archived. Additionally, a persistent unique identifier (e.g., DOI) may be assigned to datasets upon publication, facilitating easy citation and access.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available no later than the time of an associated publication or at the end of the performance period, whichever comes first. The data are expected to remain accessible indefinitely through the designated repositories, ensuring their availability for future research.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *Given that all research participants have been consented for broad data sharing, there are no anticipated limitations on the access, distribution, or reuse of the scientific data beyond standard considerations for genomic data, such as adherence to GA4GH guidelines and respect for the original consent provided by the participants.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the scientific data will not be controlled beyond the standard access controls implemented by the repositories where the data are archived. This means that once deposited, the data will be freely accessible to all users of these public databases.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *Since the project involves sequencing data from a well-characterized cell line (HeLa), which is not considered personal identifiable information in this context, additional protections beyond standard repository access controls are not deemed necessary. However, all procedures will adhere to relevant guidelines and regulations regarding the use and sharing of human-derived cell lines.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the Principal Investigator (PI) of the project, in conjunction with the institution's research data management office. Regular checks will be performed at least bi-annually to ensure that all generated data are properly archived, documented, and shared according to the plan outlined here. Any issues or updates regarding data sharing will be addressed promptly by the PI in consultation with relevant stakeholders within the institution.*
