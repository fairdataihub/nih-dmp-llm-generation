### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *The project anticipates generating a substantial amount of clinical data from electronic health records (EHRs) for approximately 15,000 patients in a primary care clinic. This includes demographic data, medical history, laboratory results, medications, physical exam findings, and cognitive exams. Additionally, for a subset of about 40 individuals, cognitive assessment data will be collected through validated assessment instruments. The primary goal is to utilize these clinical data to generate cognitive risk scores. Given the nature of EHR data and the specific cognitive assessments, the estimated amount of data will be significant, including but not limited to:
     - Demographic data: age, gender, ethnicity, etc.
     - Medical history: diagnoses, treatments, hospitalizations
     - Laboratory data: blood tests, imaging results
     - Medications: prescriptions, dosages
     - Physical exams: vital signs, physical condition assessments
     - Cognitive exams: results from validated cognitive assessment instruments*
   
2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All clinical data collected from EHRs and cognitive assessment data will be preserved and shared. The rationale behind sharing these data is to facilitate research into cognitive health and risk factors associated with aging, aligning with the mission of the National Institute on Aging (NIA). By making these data available, researchers can conduct studies that might lead to better understanding, prevention, and treatment of age-related cognitive decline. Given that all participants will provide consent for broad data sharing, it is anticipated that de-identified datasets will be made available to maximize utility while protecting participant privacy.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *To facilitate interpretation and reuse of the scientific data, the following metadata and documentation will be made accessible:
     - Study protocols outlining data collection procedures
     - Data collection instruments (e.g., specific cognitive assessment tools used)
     - Data dictionaries explaining variable names, formats, and definitions
     - Documentation of any data transformations or cleaning processes applied to the raw data*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools, software, and/or code may be necessary for accessing or manipulating shared scientific data. For example, statistical analysis software (e.g., R, Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy) will be required to analyze the cognitive risk scores and clinical data. Additionally, data manipulation and cleaning might involve the use of specific programming languages or tools designed for handling large healthcare datasets. Access to these tools can typically be obtained through academic licenses or open-source repositories.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*To ensure interoperability of datasets and resources, common data standards will be applied to the scientific data and associated metadata. Specifically, the project will adhere to the Health Level Seven International (HL7) standards for clinical and administrative data, and the Cognitive Atlas framework for cognitive assessment data. These standards will enable seamless integration with other research datasets and facilitate meta-analyses and comparative studies across different populations and research questions.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The scientific data and metadata arising from the project will be archived in the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) repository, specifically through databases like PubMed or clinical trial registries when applicable, and potentially other discipline-specific repositories such as the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Portal for cognitive and dementia-related research.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Scientific data will be made findable and identifiable via persistent unique identifiers (e.g., DOI - Digital Object Identifier) assigned by the repository where the data are archived, along with detailed metadata descriptions that include keywords, study titles, and investigator names.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available to other users no later than the time of publication of the main findings or at the end of the performance period, whichever comes first. The data are expected to remain available for a minimum of 10 years after the study’s completion to allow for extended research and validation studies.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *While the project aims to maximize data sharing, factors such as informed consent limitations, privacy protections (especially for sensitive health information), and confidentiality agreements may impose certain restrictions on access, distribution, or reuse of the scientific data. However, given that participants will consent to broad data sharing, these limitations are anticipated to be minimal.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the scientific data will not be controlled beyond what is required for protecting participant privacy and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Once archived in a public repository, the data will be accessible without need for approval, although some repositories may require registration or acceptance of terms of use.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect the privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants, all shared data will be de-identified according to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, removing direct identifiers such as names, addresses, and Social Security numbers. Additionally, measures like data aggregation, anonymization, and encryption will be employed where necessary. The project may also apply for a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH to further safeguard sensitive information.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the study’s Principal Investigator (PI), in collaboration with the institution’s research administration office. Regular oversight meetings will be held every six months to review data sharing progress, address any challenges or concerns, and ensure adherence to the plan’s guidelines and timelines. The PI will also work closely with the data management team to implement data standards, prepare datasets for sharing, and coordinate with repositories for data archiving.*
