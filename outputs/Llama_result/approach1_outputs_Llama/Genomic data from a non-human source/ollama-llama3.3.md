### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *The proposed project aims to generate a comprehensive spatially mapped single-cell atlas of the developing mouse brain. The primary deliverables include matrices of cells × (counts in peaks for ATAC, UMIs in genes for RNA, or methylation status for DNAm) along with dense metadata tables. These tables will contain detailed information for each cell, such as animal sex, developmental time point, punch of origin with x,y,z coordinates, assigned cluster and inferred cell type, and various quality control metrics (e.g., total reads, passing reads, TSS enrichment). The amount of data generated is expected to be substantial, given the complexity and depth of single-cell analyses. Initial estimates suggest terabytes of raw sequencing data, which will be processed and analyzed to produce the final datasets.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All primary matrices and associated metadata tables from the mouse studies will be preserved and shared. The rationale for sharing these data is to contribute significantly to the scientific community's understanding of brain development at the single-cell level, facilitating further research into neurological disorders and developmental biology. Sharing these comprehensive datasets will enable other researchers to explore hypotheses that might not be feasible within the scope of our project, thereby accelerating discovery.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *Metadata will include but is not limited to cell identifiers, experimental conditions (e.g., sequencing platform, date of preparation), and quality control metrics. Other relevant data may encompass intermediate processing files necessary for reproducing the analyses. Associated documentation will comprise study protocols, data collection instruments, and detailed methodologies used in data generation and analysis. This comprehensive set of information will facilitate the interpretation and reuse of the shared scientific data.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools, software, and code are indeed necessary for accessing or manipulating the shared scientific data. Specifically, programming languages like Python and R, along with libraries such as Scanpy for single-cell analysis, will be essential. Additionally, utilization of software packages for peak calling (e.g., MACS2 for ATAC-seq) and methylation analysis tools will be required. These tools are widely used in the bioinformatics community and can be accessed through public repositories like GitHub or Bioconda.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*The project will apply common data standards to ensure interoperability of datasets and resources. Specifically, we will adhere to the standards set by the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) for single-cell data, including the use of H5AD files for storing processed single-cell data and the implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for metadata. For genomics data, compliance with the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) best practices will be maintained. The application of these standards will facilitate the integration of our dataset with existing resources and enable seamless collaboration and comparison across studies.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *Scientific data and metadata arising from this project will be archived in publicly accessible repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for genomic data and the Single Cell Portal for single-cell datasets. These repositories are compliant with NIH's guidelines for data sharing and provide a robust infrastructure for data preservation and access.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Each dataset will be assigned a unique identifier, such as an accession number provided by the repository where it is archived (e.g., GEO Series or GSE number). Additionally, we will utilize standard indexing tools like DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for datasets and publications to enhance discoverability.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available no later than the time of publication of the main findings or at the end of the performance period, whichever comes first. The data will remain accessible indefinitely, as per the policies of the chosen repositories, to support ongoing research and future discoveries.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *The primary consideration for our project is ensuring that all shared data are de-identified and do not pose any risk to privacy or confidentiality, especially since some aspects of the study may involve human cells in later phases. However, given the initial focus on mouse models, these concerns will be revisited and updated as necessary upon expansion to human cell studies.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the scientific data generated from this project will not be controlled beyond what is required for privacy protection and compliance with regulatory standards. All datasets will be made openly accessible through public repositories.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *Although the initial phase focuses on mouse models, in the event that human cell data are generated during the project (as indicated may happen based on results from the mouse studies), strict measures will be taken to protect participant privacy, including de-identification of samples, obtaining appropriate informed consent for data sharing, and potentially utilizing Certificates of Confidentiality to safeguard sensitive information.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be overseen by the project's Principal Investigator (PI), in collaboration with the institution's Office of Research Compliance and the designated Data Manager. Regular reviews (at least annually) will ensure that all data are properly archived, shared according to the plan, and that any updates or changes to the plan are appropriately documented and communicated to NIH. The PI will be responsible for reporting on plan compliance as part of progress reports and will work closely with the research team to address any issues or concerns related to data management and sharing.*
