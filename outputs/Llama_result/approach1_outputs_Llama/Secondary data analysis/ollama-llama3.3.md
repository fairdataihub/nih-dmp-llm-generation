### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *This project involves secondary data analysis of existing MRI images and clinical assessments from human research participants, along with the deposition of privately held data into a public repository. The existing data includes collections from the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) - specifically collections 2134 with 148 subjects and 2433 with 47 subjects. Additionally, we have data from a previous study involving 155 research participants with major depressive disorder that will be uploaded to the NDA during the second quarter of the first year of funding. The structural MRI scans are available for time points before and after treatment, along with relevant clinical data.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All scientific data from this project, including MRI images and clinical assessments, will be preserved and shared through the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). The rationale for sharing these data is to contribute to the broader research community's understanding of major depressive disorder, facilitate further research, and enhance the reproducibility of findings. Sharing these data aligns with the principles of transparency and collaboration in scientific research.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *To facilitate interpretation of the shared scientific data, we will also make accessible the following metadata and documentation: study protocols, data collection instruments, participant consent forms, and detailed descriptions of MRI acquisition parameters. These will be provided in a format that is easily understandable and usable by other researchers.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software are needed to access or manipulate the shared scientific data, specifically those capable of handling MRI images (e.g., FSL, AFNI) and statistical analysis software (e.g., R, Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy). These tools are widely available in the research community, and detailed instructions on how to access and use them will be provided alongside the shared data.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*To enable interoperability of datasets and resources, we will apply common data standards to the scientific data and associated metadata. Specifically, we will adhere to the BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) standard for organizing and describing MRI data, and use standardized clinical data elements where applicable. These standards are widely recognized in the field and facilitate the integration of our data with other datasets.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The scientific data and metadata arising from this project will be archived in the NIMH Data Archive (NDA), a repository that is widely recognized for its role in storing and sharing mental health research data.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *The scientific data will be made findable and identifiable through the use of persistent unique identifiers (e.g., DOI - Digital Object Identifier) and standard indexing tools provided by the NDA, allowing other researchers to easily locate and access our shared data.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available to other users no later than the time of an associated publication or end of the performance period, whichever comes first. The data will remain available indefinitely through the NDA, subject to any limitations imposed by considerations related to human subjects protection.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *The primary factor affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of our scientific data is the protection of human research participants' privacy and confidentiality. All participants have provided consent for broad data sharing, but certain identifying information will be removed or de-identified to protect their privacy.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the scientific data will not be controlled beyond the standard procedures and requirements of the NDA for ensuring appropriate use and protecting human subjects' data.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect the privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants, all shared data will be de-identified. Additionally, we will obtain Certificates of Confidentiality from the NIH to further safeguard against disclosure of sensitive information.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by our institution's research administration office, specifically through the roles of the Principal Investigator and a designated data manager. Oversight will include regular checks (at least quarterly) to ensure that data are being properly curated, shared in accordance with the plan, and that all necessary documentation and metadata are up-to-date and accessible.*
