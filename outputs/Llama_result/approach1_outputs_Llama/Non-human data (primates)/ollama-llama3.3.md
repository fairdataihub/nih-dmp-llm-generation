### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *The proposed work will generate a significant amount of raw video, activity, and cardiac physiological files. From these primary data sources, we will derive behavioral data and autonomic nervous system reactivity data. The total number of subjects is anticipated to be N=500 across multiple test points. Given this scope, the estimated amount of scientific data generated is substantial, requiring careful management and storage considerations.*

2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All raw video, activity, cardiac physiological files, along with derived behavioral and autonomic nervous system reactivity data, will be preserved and shared. The rationale for sharing these data is to facilitate transparency, reproducibility, and further research into aging mechanisms, aligning with the NIA's mission to understand aspects of aging and age-related diseases. Sharing these data will enable other researchers to explore new hypotheses, validate findings, and accelerate discovery in the field.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *To facilitate interpretation and reuse of the scientific data, we will make accessible the following metadata and documentation: 
     - Study protocols
     - Data collection instruments (e.g., questionnaires, sensor specifications)
     - Data processing and analysis scripts
     - Detailed descriptions of participant demographics and selection criteria
     - Information on data quality control measures
     These resources will be crucial for understanding the context, limitations, and potential applications of the shared data.*

### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools, software, and code are indeed necessary to access or manipulate the shared scientific data. Specifically, users may need access to video analysis software (e.g., OpenCV), statistical analysis packages (e.g., R, Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy), and possibly custom scripts developed for this project. These tools will be accessible through open-source repositories (e.g., GitHub) or via links provided in the metadata documentation associated with the shared data.*

### Element 3: Standards:
*To enable interoperability of datasets and resources, we will apply common data standards relevant to the types of data collected. For video files, MP4 format will be used; for physiological data, the WFDB (Waveform Database) software package's standard will guide formatting. Behavioral data will be structured according to widely accepted psychological and behavioral assessment norms. Since no single consensus standard covers all aspects of our diverse dataset comprehensively, we will adhere to discipline-specific standards where applicable and document deviations or custom approaches in the associated metadata.*

### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines
1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The scientific data and metadata arising from this project will be archived in the National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (NLM) repository, specifically leveraging resources like the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) for human subjects data when appropriate, or other designated repositories that align with NIH recommendations for data sharing.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Scientific data will be made findable and identifiable through the use of persistent unique identifiers (e.g., DOIs - Digital Object Identifiers) and standard indexing tools such as those used by PubMed or specific to the chosen repository.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available no later than the time of publication of the main findings from the dataset or at the end of the performance period, whichever comes first. The data will remain accessible for a minimum of 10 years following the end of the project to maximize its utility and impact on the research community.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations
1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *While we aim to maximize data sharing, limitations may arise due to informed consent restrictions, privacy and confidentiality protections for human subjects, and potential intellectual property considerations related to custom software or methodologies developed during the project. These limitations will be clearly documented in the metadata and associated documentation.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to certain components of the scientific data may be controlled, particularly if they contain personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive material. In such cases, data will be de-identified or made available through a controlled access mechanism provided by the repository.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect the privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants, all shared data will be de-identified. Additionally, we will obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH to further safeguard against disclosure of sensitive information. Study protocols will also include explicit language regarding confidentiality and privacy protections in the informed consent process.*

### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the Principal Investigator (PI) in collaboration with the institution's research data management office. Regular oversight meetings will occur at least quarterly to review progress, address any challenges in data sharing, and ensure adherence to the plan's timelines and standards. The PI will also work closely with the NIH and the designated data repository to facilitate smooth implementation of the data sharing aspects of this project.*
