### Element 1: Data Type
1. **Types and amount of scientific data expected to be generated in the project:**   
   *The proposed study will generate demographic, clinical, MRI, 1H fMRS, and fMRI imaging data from 110 affected youth and 110 matched healthy controls. The estimated amount of data includes: 
     - Demographic data: 220 subjects x approximately 50 variables per subject = 11,000 data points.
     - Clinical data: 220 subjects x approximately 100 variables per subject (including questionnaires, assessments) = 22,000 data points.
     - MRI, 1H fMRS, and fMRI imaging data: Approximately 660 scans (3 types of scans per 220 subjects), with each scan producing several gigabytes of data. The total estimated size for imaging data is around 2.2 terabytes.*
 
2. **Scientific data that will be preserved and shared, and the rationale for doing so:**  
   *All collected data (demographic, clinical, MRI, 1H fMRS, and fMRI) will be preserved and shared because they are crucial for understanding mental health conditions in youth. Sharing these data will facilitate replication studies, meta-analyses, and the development of new hypotheses, thereby advancing our knowledge of mental health disorders and improving treatment outcomes.*

3. **Metadata, other relevant data, and associated documentation:**   
   *The following metadata and documentation will be made accessible:
     - Study protocols
     - Data collection instruments (e.g., questionnaires)
     - MRI scanning protocols
     - Data processing and analysis pipelines
     - Informed consent forms*
     
### Element 2: Related Tools, Software and/or Code:
*Specialized tools and software needed to access or manipulate shared scientific data include:
     - MRI scan analysis software (e.g., FSL, AFNI)
     - Statistical analysis software (e.g., R, Python libraries such as pandas, numpy)
     - Data management platforms for organizing and sharing large datasets.*
 
### Element 3: Standards:
*The following common data standards will be applied to ensure interoperability of datasets and resources:
     - NIMH Data Archive (NDA) standards for clinical and demographic data
     - BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) standard for MRI, 1H fMRS, and fMRI imaging data*
 
### Element 4: Data Preservation, Access, and Associated Timelines

1. **Repository where scientific data and metadata will be archived:**   
   *The NIMH Data Archive (NDA) has been selected as the repository for archiving scientific data and metadata arising from this project.*

2. **How scientific data will be findable and identifiable:**   
   *Scientific data will be made findable and identifiable through a persistent unique identifier provided by the NDA, ensuring that each dataset can be located and accessed easily.*

3. **When and how long the scientific data will be made available:**   
   *The scientific data will be made available to other users no later than the time of an associated publication or end of the performance period, whichever comes first. Data will remain available indefinitely through the NDA, in accordance with their data retention policies.*

### Element 5: Access, Distribution, or Reuse Considerations

1. **Factors affecting subsequent access, distribution, or reuse of scientific data:**  
   *Given that all participants are consented for broad data sharing, there are no anticipated limitations on access, distribution, or reuse of the scientific data beyond standard protections for privacy and confidentiality.*

2. **Whether access to scientific data will be controlled:**  
   *Access to the scientific data will not be controlled; once archived in the NDA, the data will be available to all registered users without need for approval, consistent with the NDA’s open-access policy.*

3. **Protections for privacy, rights, and confidentiality of human research participants:**   
   *To protect participant privacy, rights, and confidentiality:
     - All data will be de-identified before submission to the NDA.
     - A Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained from the NIH to further safeguard against disclosure of identifiable information.*
     
### Element 6: Oversight of Data Management and Sharing:
*Compliance with this Data Management and Sharing Plan will be monitored and managed by the Principal Investigator (PI) and a designated data manager at our institution. The plan will be reviewed annually, or as needed, to ensure adherence to the outlined policies and procedures for data management and sharing. Regular check-ins between the PI, data manager, and other key personnel involved in data collection and analysis will help maintain oversight and address any issues that may arise during the project.*
